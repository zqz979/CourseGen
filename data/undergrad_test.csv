AA 103: Introduction to Interior Design,"We spend most of our time in interior space where we live, work, learn, and play, and the interior design of these spaces impacts human health and wellbeing. Individual interior spaces and the sequences of interior spaces enable us to make sense of the physical surroundings, enrich our experiences, and express particular personalities and identities. This course introduces the spectrum of interior design necessary to meet physical, psychological, and social human needs for the quality of life. The elements and principles of design in interior space and Gestalt psychology will be explored, while space planning and environmental human behavior theory will be discussed. Considering sustainability, indoor environment quality, and interior materials and finishes will be discussed. Interior design for special needs such as universal design and design for special populations will be introduced. Ultimately, students will recognize interior design as a profession and identify the design process and communication employed by the interior design profession."
AA 121: Design Thinking and Creativity,"This course is an introductory, general education level course based on the premise that design is a fundamental human activity that everyone engages in one way or another. Design encompasses both the ability to imagine that which does not yet exist and to make it appear in concrete form. Design is a form of deliberate, considered action that seeks solutions to problems and creates useful and purposeful artifacts. Design is simultaneously used as a noun and a verb, and to describe a discipline and many fields of practice. Yet design remains essentially a black box to most people - its methods, processes, and components are mysterious, magical, and opaque. This course will turn the ""black box"" of design into a glass box. The course focuses on the relationship between ideas, tools, and artifacts in order to connect theory, practice, and outcomes. Using theory, practice, and artifacts from a range of design fields (including architecture, landscape architecture, product design, engineering, graphic design, environmental design, and design theory itself), the course will empower students to understand design from the perspective most useful to them and their work - ideas, application, and the things they encounter in the world. The course focuses on the kinds of problems, situations, and processes of thinking that are critical for designers, business professionals, engineers, humanists, social scientists and natural scientists. The course is divided into five distinct units, allowing a thematic and comparative analysis of a breadth of design topics: About Design; Design Thinking; The Elements of Design; Design as a Game; and, a Step-by-Step Guide to Design in Action. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and analyze the role of design in the world and to take action themselves, including: * the breadth of design in the world * the power and responsibility of design * a range of design artifacts * how designers think and work * what creativity is and what it entails * understandings of design, design thinking, and creativity across a breadth of disciplines * the parts of design problems * how the design process can be described * strategies and methods applicable to the stages of the design process There are no prerequisites for this course. The course will serve as an introduction to fundamental ideas of design and complement design-focused courses in other departments/programs across the university. The course satisfies general education requirements for Arts (GA) requirements."

AA 401: International Arts Minor Final Project,"The final project required for the International Arts Minor.  A&A 401A&A 401 International Arts Minor Final Project (1-3) The requirements for the International Arts Minor specify that the course applied toward the minor reflect a coherent course of study constructed around a geographic, chronological, or thematic concentration. Also required for the minor is a culminating project that relates to the chosen concentration. The final project is intended to capitalize on the knowledge and experience gained from the prerequisite components of the minor.The topic of the project will be chosen by the student in consultation with the person in charge of the minor. Work toward completion of the project will be overseen by the person in charge of the minor with advice or assistance from other member(s) of the faculty as appropriate.For the purpose of the minor, the arts are very broadly defined to include topics such as the visual arts, architecture, design environments, theatre, music, and literature so most any creative endeavor may be considered for the subject of the final project. The project may result in formats such as a written paper, a work of art, an exhibition, a recital, or a musical composition as long as it conforms to the intent of the requirement for the minor. It is anticipated that the subject of most projects will be cross-cultural or multicultural in nature. For example, a research paper might be thematic such as an intercultural comparison of adaptations of a Greek myth. A studio project might be technical, such as the wood firing techniques employed by Japanese ceramicists.The requirements for the International Arts Minor specifies a project of at least one (1) credit. A7A 401 International Arts Minor Final Project will be offered for one (1) to three (3) credits to accommodate students who may been more than one (1) credit to complete the minor and for those who may propose a project worth more than one (1) credit.

A ED 201W A ED 201W History and Philosophy of Art Education in Schools and Cultural Institutions (3)Art education is not an isolated phenomenon; art teaching and learning has always occurred in the context of broader cultural changes and a range of social factors, including technological developments and population diversity. This course examines the historical, philosophical, and sociological foundations of art education in the United States. Art education can be found in a variety of formal and informal settings, including schools, community arts organizations and museums. Students will examine questions such as, what was the purpose of teaching art in the past? Was art study a means to improving social status, to attaining technical literacy, or to vocational training? Did education in art promote a democratic way of life? Or did it help reproduce existing divisions of race, gender, class, and ethnicity in American society? This course examines past and present developments in art education, paying special attention to the relation of art teaching and learning in contexts of art worlds, schooling, cultural institutions, and changing demographics. While the course will focus on art education in the United States, art education in a global context will be addressed as appropriate."

AFAM 105N: Afro-Latin America: Race and Revolution,"Too often the history of race in the Americas is overly defined by concepts of racial identity and race relations in the United States. When examined quantitatively, fewer than five percent of the approximately 10 million slaves who survived the Middle Passage arrived in what we know as the United States of America. This course will examine the impact of slavery throughout the Americas, from the establishment of the plantation in Brazil through the impact of Black migration throughout the Americas today. Through lecture and discussion, we will identify patterns of racial identity and participation in the formation of the Latin American nation state that will give us a more nuanced understanding of both race and nation in the Americas. We will examine the development of the modern plantation from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century as well as the role of urban slavery in this era throughout Latin America. We will study the various paths to abolition with a particular focus on the Haitian Revolution and the common practice of military service among slave populations during the early nineteenth century struggles for Latin American independence. Additionally, we will look at the comparative abolition of slavery in the United States and Latin America, the role of slaves and free blacks in Central America, as well the role of race in the tensions between Haitians and Dominicans on the island of Hispaniola. The second half of the course will move to an examination of contemporary black politics, patterns of anti-black racism and state violence, and the emergence of new social movements for racial, gender, and economic justice in the Americas.

AFAM 145: African Diaspora Religions and Spiritualities,"This course is an introduction to religions and spiritual traditions of the African Americas including the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, emphasizing present institutions and practices, their relationship to Africa and African spirituality, their shape and function during slavery, and their development from Emancipation to the present. Through various examples and case studies, we will trace the relationship between religion and resistance, race politics, gender and sexuality, religion and social change. The course addresses core ideas of the disciplines of religious studies and African Diaspora theory. The category of religion is explored through a diasporic framework that considers the legacy of slavery and contemporary racial and social hierarchies. The course approaches religions of the African Americas as epistemologies of resistance to white oppression introducing students to the diaspora condition as marked by historical violence and the dialectics of loss and displacement. Central to the course are concepts of religious orthodoxy and authenticity, cultural retentions and transformations and the dynamics of religious power and authority. The course follows a comparative framework in investigating religious life, introducing students to diaspora theory as a discourse of difference that engages critically with the particularities of the religious traditions of the African Americas without collapsing their differences. By addressing identity formations, the course focuses on religion as a discourse of power and one that articulates religious life as shaped by gender and race politics and by economics and social realities. To this end, the course follows an interdisciplinary approach and engages a variety of material including literary and historical texts, visual arts and music and dance makes it possible for students to understand the complexity of religious life in the African Americas."

We will explore the social, economic, political, cultural, religious, moral, and spiritual context of America in general and of African Americans in particular. We will examine Malcolm X's influence on the period in which he lived and since his assassination. We will compare and contrast his view on issues of race, culture, politics, education, crime, human rights, civil rights, morality, and economics with those of other African American leaders and with the prevailing views of most Americans on those subjects. We will devote a large portion of the course to the examination of the social movements that impacted on Malcolm and those that he influenced. The speeches of Malcolm X and the writings about Malcolm X are instructive and will be utilized along with other documents. Videotapes and audiotapes will also be employed as instructional materials. Students are expected to be ACTIVE participants in the learning/teaching experience. Students are required to participate in class discussions centered on the readings and related topics. There will be a written mid-term examination and a written final examination. Students are expected to complete an individual research project related to the course and write a paper on that research as well as to participate in a collaborative group project of their choosing on a subject related to the class. This course will count in the supporting courses category of the major and minors in African/African American studies. It also will fulfill credits in the Religious Studies Program. It may also be used to fill GH and US requirements."
AFAM 164: The History of Brazil,"This course will study the history of Brazil, the only Portuguese-speaking nation in Latin America, from the colonial to the present period. We will examine Brazil's transformation from Portuguese colony to the seat of a nineteenth century transcontinental empire ruled by the only European monarch to rule from the Americas, and discuss developments such as plantation slavery and industrialization that transformed Brazil into an international powerhouse. We will examine political, economic, cultural and racial movements and institutions that defined Brazilian history during the empire, the first republic, the Vargas era, and the military dictatorship. We will conclude with a look at Brazil's struggles with democracy from the 1980s to the present as well as the rise of contemporary populist leaders, Brazil's struggles surrounding policing, political corruption, affirmative action, and its hosting international sporting events in the twenty-first century. This course is designed to introduce students to the making of the modern Brazilian state focusing on the period from the rise of the Brazilian Empire in 1808 through the modern day. We will survey major historical trends in Brazilian society, from its roots as a Portuguese colony and its role at the center of slavery and the slave trade in the Americas to its distinctive patterns of independence and nationhood. Brazil's experience as an independent nation during the nineteenth century (it became the only long-term monarchy in the Americas) offers an interesting point of comparison to the history of republican nationhood elsewhere in North and South America. We will also examine the challenges of state and nation building during the nineteenth and early twentieth century as well as the challenges associated with late industrialization and state-sponsored development."

The course will accommodate ten students in Speech Communication and ten students in African and African American Studies to ensure active discussion of issues."
AFAM 445Y: Politics of Affirmative Action,"Examines history, politics, and economics of the use of special programs to advance racial interests in the U.S.  /  /  Politics of Affirmative Action (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The objectives of this course are to introduce students to the relationship between affirmative action and other policies purportedly designed to end racial inequality in the U.S. This course approaches the study of affirmative action in the context of the historic racial discrimination and inequality that Black Americans have faced since the founding of the Nation. The purpose of this course is to help students think about how contemporary and historic affirmative action policies relate to race, concepts racial inequality, the historic and continuing causes for racial inequality, public opinion, American politics and economic thought. The course materials will lead students through scholarly and popular articles, books and video presentations on the topic. It is hoped that students will become familiar with the history of affirmative action from its conception. Students will gain an intimate understanding of affirmative action economic and social outcomes on various racial groups. No prior knowledge is assumed, however a knowledge of civil rights history, quantitative methods, and constitutional law will be useful. The Politics of Affirmative Action satisfies the requirements for major and minor electives for the African American Studies, and major and minor electives for Political Science, and Labor Studies and Industrial Relations. Students are evaluated on the basis of an examination, term paper, class participation and class presentations of papers."
AFAM 467: African American Novel II,"This course examines the African American novel, its forms, and its traditions starting during the Harlem Renaissance. It follows the genre's evolution into the twenty-first century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and ""postrace aesthetics"" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major figures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative fiction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose fiction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. In this course, students learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts, conduct related research, and write persuasively about literary works. Assignments and discussions are designed such that students may engage with course figures and materials within their historical milieus."

AGBM 170Z: Investigating the U.S. Food System: How food moves from field to table -LINKED,"The American food system is a product of complex interaction of three systems: the natural ecosystem, the managed agricultural system, and the socio-economic system. Farming, food processing, food distribution, and consumption decisions are all governed by the interaction of these systems. Consequences of these decisions, along with the interactions themselves, have generated a number of overarching scientific and social ""hot-button"" topics that affect or are affected by the food system such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), organic crops and food, agricultural and food policy, environmental implications from agriculture food safety, food safety, diet and health, agricultural trade and international development, and domestic food insecurity and food access. Students in this course will investigate and discuss all of these topics by reading both popular press accounts and peer-reviewed academic research, and by hearing guest speakers from a variety of fields and academic disciplines. However, to provide additional relevance, the course will use specific foods or crops to provide a more concrete examination of these topics. For a wide range of foods and crops grown in or imported to the U.S, students will learn the following: 1. Where many of our crops are grown and why. 2. How labor intensive, chemical-intensive, biotechnology intensive, and equipment intensive many of our crops are. 3. What U.S. policies affect production, distribution, and consumption of many crops and food. 4. How large agribusiness companies may influence our crops' production, distribution, and consumption. 5. How consumer groups may influence our crops' production, distribution, and consumption. And, 6. Whether or not alternative production and marketing systems exist for many crops.  is linked to"

AGBM 470A: Comparing Agricultural and Food Systems in the US and France: Lecture,"This course is designed to explore key similarities and differences in the food and agricultural systems of the United States and France. It introduces students to a number of overarching food and agricultural topics that pertain to both countries, and students explore and analyze these key issues from both countries perspective. These overarching topics include the structure of agricultural and environmental policies, the use agricultural land for biofuel production, organic agriculture, food safety, attitudes and policies surrounding the use of genetically modified crops, the role of large agribusiness firms, attitudes towards diet and health, and several others important topics. Students conduct background reading on these topics, hear lectures -- sometimes from guest presenters -- that frame the topics from both the U.S. and France's perspective, and write reports on specific crops or foods that expose key similarities and differences between the two food systems. Finally, students pick one crop or food for an oral presentation that contains background information on how that crop fits into the two food systems, U.S. and France, and analyzes the key issues that relate to the overarching topics already identified. This course has two components that must be taken in partnership: 470A (FOOD SYS US/FRANCE I) and 470B (FOOD SYS US/FRANCE II). The first is a classroom - based course, and meets regularly during the semester. The second is a two - week component that takes place after the end of the semester. In this second component, after traveling to France, students hear presentations from the French perspective on the overarching topics identified earlier and also explore the topics first hand via field trips to farms, wholesale markets, retail markets, and other places relevant to the French food system. This component is organized by a host university, AgroParisTech. For these two weeks, students live in dorms within the city of Paris. Knowledge of French is not required."

AGECO 438: Principles of Weed Management,"The study of weeds and their management is a challenging and demanding task that requires diverse abilities. The term weed is an anthropocentric construct meaning it is a human colored definition. We will study the biology and ecology of weedy plants drawing on examples from a wide range of plant systems; those systems include agricultural fields (agronomic and horticultural crops) and forests. Of course our knowledge of the biology and ecology of weedy plant populations will then be used to underpin and assess control tactics and their integration. The discipline has a history of equating management with herbicidal control and in fact some 80% of the pesticides used in U.S. agriculture are herbicides. However through novel farmer designed management systems, through a research community focused on alternative methods of management and through increased focus on invasive species, exciting breakthroughs are occurring in alternative methods of management and prevention. This course seeks to introduce you to the breadth of management approaches in use and under study. The specific objectives are for students to describe and identify: 1) the local weed flora, 2) the fundamental aspects of weed biology and ecology relevant to managed landscapes, 3) the control methods used in managing weed populations, 4) how control measures can be integrated to accomplish acceptable levels of pest suppression, 5) operationalizing a weed management plan, 6) how herbicides enter and move to their site of action in plants, 7) classifying herbicides by their site of action, and 8) the distinction between herbicide concentration in soils and plant available herbicide concentration."
AIR 352: Leading People and Effective Communication II,"This course will provide students the opportunity to utilize their communication skills as they begin more of a leadership role within an organization.

AMST 106N: The Mass Media and Society,"Mass communications in the United States: organization, role, content, and effects of newspapers, magazines, television, radio, books, and films. The Mass Media and Society is an overview of the interaction between mass media and society. By drawing from selected topics, the course pays particular attention to the social influences (e.g., economics, politics, technology, law and culture) that shape media messages. Among others, the course examines the nature of media controllers as well as the character of users and consumers of media products. By so doing, students are informed about the overall structure and scope of the mass media and led to understand the power and influences associated with media messages and practices. By the end of the semester, each student should have a better understanding of the dynamic nature of the mass media in an information society."
AMST 226N: Critical Approaches to Hip-Hop,"This course will examine the politics of hip-hop art and culture. To do so, we will place hip-hop in broad historical context and trace its aesthetic and cultural roots from Africa to Jamaica to 1970s New York City and then forward to 1980s gangsta rap and former President Barack Obama's iPod. We will think through the implications of hip-hop's addiction to Italian-American mobsters, bling, and all-things keepin' it real. We will also search for hip-hop's political foundations in funk records, 1960s community organizing, and poetry of the Harlem Renaissance. All the while, we will analyze the varieties of hip-hop politics by paying close attention to how hip-hoppers vie for authenticity, recognition, and power through cultural practices--b-boying/girling, graffiti art, emceeing, djing, e.g.-at odds with the State, inequality, and injustice. We will also situate hip-hop politics within the ongoing history of American social movements. To avoid over-romanticizing, we will equally examine hip-hop's appetite for conspicuous consumption, misogyny, homophobia, trappin', and criminality. A deep understanding of hip-hop politics, then, requires examining its contradictions as well as the ways race, class, gender, sexuality, and geography shape hip-hop--and therefore American-culture, art, and identity. To get at these and other ideas, we will read, listen, and think broadly about why a full understanding of hip-hop truly matters."

The Literature and Lore of Mining (3) (GH)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.  is a nontraditional approach to the humanities whose central methodology is a comparative use of literature, lore, and oral history to explore humanistic themes related to the coal mining experience and tradition regionally, nationally, and internationally. Throughout the course, knowledge about the miner and his tradition is derived and synthesized from a variety of sources. During the 15 weeks, students typically read one novel, one play, six short stories, a dozen poems, six essays and articles, and a mining culture and lore anthology. Students also view films and videos, examine historical documents, artifacts, and photos, listen to oral history tapes, and visit a coal heritage site. Central to the course is a three-week segment devoted to preparing students to conduct field research involving an interview of a miner or miner's wife. The other 12 weeks are divided equally to stress poetic, fictional, dramatic, and expository expressions of the mining experience. Students analyze and interpret information collected during the field research and make connections between the contents of the interview and the contents of the national and international literature selections assigned for class. By reading, analyzing, and discussing works of literature, students learn how the mining tradition was an inextricable part of American culture and how it played a vital role in the industrial revolution of America. Issues related to immigration, ethnicity, and the struggle between labor and management are also illuminated. Some universal themes related to the human condition to be explored are: the search for dignity, security, and justice; the struggle against the environment to achieve purpose and meaning in life; the indomitable human spirit versus resignation to fate; and the values of solidarity, brotherhood, and family relationships. Representative authors to be studied who have written about coal mining are D.H. Lawrence (England), George Orwell (England), Franz Kafka (Austria-Czech), Stephen Crane (U.S.) Alexandre Kuprine (Russia), and Emile Zola (France). After reading selections by these authors, students compare and contrast the mining tradition in the U.S. to the mining tradition in other countries, with special emphasis on the coal miner's life style, character, and values. For assessment, students will complete three exams-objective and essay in nature. They will conduct an oral history field research project, prepare three reports, and keep a journal. Class attendance and discussion of the work assigned will also be factors in evaluation. The course will fulfill a general education humanities requirement."

Poultry Production and Management (4) Poultry Production and Management will provide a comprehensive review of the business-related and production oriented concepts associated with modern commercial poultry production. The course will provide the student with an overview of poultry nutrition, physiology, genetics, health, welfare, and products and describe how these disciplines integrate with effective and efficient management, quality control, and marketing of poultry and poultry products. Additional emphasis will be given to the economics of poultry production, as well as current issues and challenges facing the industry. Throughout the course, students will be provided with experiential learning opportunities and will be required to use this knowledge to solve problems and to evaluate ""real world"" production scenarios in order to develop effective management and production skills.Having completed this course, students will be able to:1. Describe and evaluate the key operational and management factors in a commercial broiler, egg-layer, and turkey operation.2. Describe and understand the important business, environmental, food safety, and welfare issues and challenges facing the poultry meat, and egg industries in Pennsylvania, the nation, and the world.3. Critically evaluate poultry business and production scenarios to provide a fact based analysis and recommended course of action for solving management or production problems."
ANSC 322: Animal Genetics and Selection,"Fundamental principles of genetics as applied to breeding farm animals.   Animal Genetics and Selection (3) This course teaches fundamental concepts related to genetic variation and how genetic change occurs in domestic animal populations. Students are introduced to the structure of animal genomes and molecular genetics. We discuss transcription, translation and factors that alter gene expression. Examples of mutations that underlie phenotypic variation are given and the contrast between traits influenced by single genes versus variation across the genome is emphasized. Students will learn how genetic material is passed from parent to offspring and how principles of inheritance are extended to populations. The concept of heritability for quantitative traits and factors that determine breeding values and the rate of genetic change for quantitative traits are considered. We discuss how biotechnologies can be used to alter genetic response in domestic animals, how genetic change for one trait can alter expression of correlated traits, and the animal welfare consequences that can arise due to genetic change. Genetic relationships among animals and inbreeding control strategies such as crossbreeding are considered. Students are also exposed to controversial issues relating to genetics and selection. Students participate in a breeding simulation and contrast population genetic change throughout semester to changes observed by their classmates."

ANSC 410: Advanced Dairy Herd Management,Application of dairy herd management principles using case studies and actual dairy farm situations.
ANSC 418: Nutrient Management in Agricultural Systems,"/  /  Nutrient Management in Agricultural Systems is a senior-level course that applies the fundamentals of animal, plant and soil sciences to the issues and solutions in the area where livestock production intersects with water and air quality. Modern regionalization and concentration of animal production systems comes with environmental implications due to a net influx of nutrients to livestock farms. While some nutrients leave the farm in the form of animal products, 60 to 70% of the nutrients are excreted and applied to nearby crop land. If not properly managed these nutrients represent a risk to environmental quality. Students in this cross-listed course gain both scientific and practical understanding of sound nutrient management principals and strategies. The course considers big picture concepts such as nutrient cycling as well as farm-level implementations such as Nutrient Management Planning."

ANTH 11: North American Archaeology,"The story of the indigenous peoples of North America and its parallels with developments elsewhere in the world have captured the imaginations of many people over the years. But it takes more than imagination to explore this saga -- it takes the careful application of archaeology. This course surveys the archaeology of North America, including Mexico. The archaeological history of North American Indians is traced from their origins in Eurasia over 14,000 years ago into the period of European colonization. An ecological approach is taken to the examination of all major regions of the continent. The Eastern Woodlands coverage will include the many burial mound and temple mound cultures of the region. The objectives of the course are to familiarize students with the wide range of human adaptations that prevailed over time and space, to link the evolution of those adaptations to the surviving descendant native cultures of North America, and to provide students with a framework for understanding the many archaeological sites that are open to the public across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. A secondary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the techniques and methods archaeologists use to test hypotheses using archaeological data. The course takes an explicitly scientific approach to the subject, one that is based upon well-established evolutionary and ecological theory and is also firmly grounded in the evidence. The course makes extensive use of images of sites and artifacts as well as other graphics that are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the subject.  fulfills both US and IL requirements. The course is structured to cultivate students¿ understanding of the similarities and differences among past Native American cultures of North America. Additional international focus is provided through exploration of the archaeological evidence for indigenous cultural traditions in locations within present-day Canada (Arctic, Iroquoians) and Mexico (Archaic, Classic, Post-Classic periods). The course fulfills the IL designation by introducing students to cultural and behavioral variation and cultural achievements of indigenous North Americans. In addition, the course fulfills the US designation by interweaving discussion of the significant influence and impact of Native American history/culture on the history and development of the United States. The ethics associated with North American archaeology and their impact on US culture and cultural perception are also explored."
ANTH 176: Sex and Gender: A biosocial and comparative perspective,"This course approaches the topic of sex and gender using an interactionist perspective: biological sex is an evolutionary adaptation, and gender is an adaptive social construction, and the two interact and mutually constrain one another. The focus is primarily on gender, the expression of behavior, rather than sexual behavior per se. The content of this course stresses both the common expression of cross-cultural patterns in gender roles and the diversity of those patterns through time and across space, surveying some cultural, biosocial, and evolutionary explanations of such patterning. Topics covered include the evolution of sex and primate perspectives on sex and gender differences, and biosocial aspects of sex and gender in disease and mortality, reproductive physiology and decision-making, subsistence practices, initiation, homosexuality and warfare, and power and politics."
"ANTH 215: Skin: Evolution, Biology and Culture","This course will explore the evolution and roles of skin and human life, including health, communication, and social wellbeing.   Skin: Evolution, Biology and Culture (3) (GN) Skin mediates the most important of transactions of human lives because it is our interface with the physical and social environments. Skin is constantly changing and reflects our age, ancestry, and health, while serving as our personal ""billboard."" In ""Skin,"" students will explore the evolutionary and social histories of human skin, including the changes in structure and function it has undergone in the course of human evolution. Three unique attributes of human skin will be explored at length: 1) functional nakedness and sweatiness; 2) the range of skin's natural colors; and 3) skin as a surface for decoration.The course begins with an overview of the structure and function of human skin and proceeds to an exploration of the comparative biology and evolution of skin in vertebrates, especially nonhuman mammals. Special attention will be paid to the outermost layer of skin, the epidermis. This will lead to a discussion of human hairlessness and sweating, and the role of skin in temperature regulation. Detailed exploration of the evolution of human skin color follows. The key role played by melanin pigmentation in protecting skin from sunlight will be discussed as a prelude to review of the evolution of human pigmentation in human dispersals. Discussion of the role of skin color in human interactions through history follows, including an introduction to the development and manifestations of color-based racism. The importance of skin as the organ of touch and as a vehicle for communication will then be reviewed. This will introduce the subject of skin as a mirror of human emotions, as in anger and blushing. Because aging of skin is one of the most visible signs of aging and is one of the most significant of human preoccupations, this phenomenon will be discussed in detail, and some of the most common skin diseases and problems associated with ""wear and tear"" will be surveyed. Considerable time and discussion will be devoted to skin decoration, with particular attention paid to the use of cosmetics and paints in the establishment of identity and the advertisement of sexuality in individuals, and the importance of tattoos in expressing individuality and group identity. The course will conclude with a speculative investigation of the future of human skin, including the prospects for artificial skin and robotic skin, and the expanding frontiers of skin decoration and communication via remote touch."
ANTH 240N: Livelihoods and Ecosystems: Anthropological Approaches to Human-Environment Interaction,"This course provides an anthropological understanding of the relationship between human subsistence and environment. The impacts of environmental change on human societies, and the roles those societies play in ecological modification, have deep roots in human evolution. This class focuses on providing students with tools to understand the foundations and cross-cultural expressions of resource use, environmental transformation, and their ecological interactions. The class has three goals: 1) introduce students to ways of thinking about ecological and social factors that shape variability in how humans define, use, and consume resources, 2) provide students the opportunity to explore archaeological, ethnographic, and ecological evidence of the interaction between human livelihoods and habitats across the entirety of the human experience, 3) utilize those concepts and evidence to investigate variability in contemporary livelihoods, socio-ecological systems, and the dilemmas we all face in natural resource use and sustainability. Regarding the first goal, students are introduced to the natural science of conservation biology and community ecology, along with influential concepts in the social science of decision-making and cultural institutions of resource management. We review key models of ecosystem dynamics and social interaction from evolutionary ecology, disturbance ecology, niche construction, common property theory, and political ecology to approach questions about consumption, complex socio-ecological systems, and the role of humans in food webs and trophic interactions. The course then investigates archaeological and paleo-ecological evidence concerning the evolution of human subsistence systems, global settlement, intensification, and their implications for understanding environmental change over the last two million years. We take the broadest possible anthropological approach: we explore the diversity of ways that humans have made a living in the past, and investigate a wide variety of contemporary systems of resource use. We begin with the emergence of subsistence regimes among the earliest members of our genus and variability in environmental conditions through the Pleistocene. We then discuss the spread of modern humans and arguments concerning the ecological impact of people in the New Worlds as humans first colonized Australia, the Americas, and islands of Pacific and Indian Oceans. Finally, students investigate contemporary Indigenous systems of resource use and food production, exploring interactions between people and culturally constructed environments, commensal relationships between humans and non-human plants and animals, processes of intensification, and ecosystem function. The course incorporates these concepts with studies of inequality into new ways of understanding global issues of conservation, economics, and policy impinging on environmental change."

ANTH 424: Andean Ethnology and Archaeology,"Cultures of the Andes from earliest settlements to Inka Empire; includes discussion of life in modern Andean communities.   Andean Ethnology and Archaeology (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Andes in 1532, they were astonished by the complexity and grandeur of the Inca Empire, which stretched along western South America incorporating a multitude of different societies that occupied a seemingly inhospitable landscape with coastal deserts, rugged mountain chains, and dense jungles. This course traces out the history and development of Andean cultures from the earliest peopling of the continent to the rise and fall of the Inca Empire. Using archaeological, historical, and ethnographic sources, students will learn about the relationship between Andean societies and their environments and landscapes, as well as the economic, social, and political changes that transformed small egalitarian communities through time into large, stratified states. Through the course, students will not only gain a strong background in pre-Columbian Andean history but will also hone their skills in the use of different lines of evidence to reconstruct the past while learning to critically evaluate existing interpretations. All students are expected to participate actively in discussions. Lectures will be supplemented by illustrations (slides, handouts, videos), and students will learn how societal dynamics are expressed in material culture and in the organization of architecture and settlements. Grades will be based on the results of three exams, a short paper, and participation in discussions. The course complements existing courses at the same (400) level on the archaeology of Mesoamerica () and North America (). It continues the discussion (at a higher level) of some of the themes covered in ANTH 008 (Incas, Aztecs, Mayas). It fulfills the archaeology credits requirement for the major and is one of the 400-level courses that can be used for the minor. For students outside the major, it may be used to meet the Other Cultures or the Social Sciences requirement in Bachelor of Arts programs."
ANTH 426W: Archaeological Laboratory Analysis,"Scientific laboratory methods used in the analysis of ceramic and lithic artifacts.   Archaeological Laboratory Analysis (3) This course, Archaeological Laboratory Analysis, employs experiential learning to teach students how to ask and answer archaeological questions using real data. While students learn the fundamentals of interpretation in other courses using already processed computer (and internet) assembled data sets, this is not how archaeological data are analyzed. Archaeological data emerge from the ground covered with dirt and the analyst must learn how to identify and measure their important attributes, and interpret what they mean. This class will provide a hands-on learning experience where students learn how to examine and use physical remains to reconstruct and interpret human behavior.Students in the Anthropology program currently learn this critical step on anad hocbasis by working with faculty on individual research projects. This approach, while effective, is neither systematic nor comprehensive. This is a course on analytical systematics. It provides students with an introduction to problem formulation, artifact processing, artifact cataloging, attribute identification, artifact classification, analysis, data illustration and photography. At the same time, students will be introduced to two separate and distinct approaches to interpretation: 1) morphological/diacritical analysis, and 2) direct experimentation and replication.Students will be graded on the completion of nine laboratory exercises. These exercises will require that students identify the research question being addresses, the theoretical assumptions used in the analysis, the data sample, the analytical method(s) employed, and the conclusions reached. The exercises will also request that students identify personal insights and difficulties encountered during the analysis.This course fills a vital position in training undergraduate majors by providing them with practical training in research design and data analysis. It also provides the logical link between our general courses in prehistory, our courses on archaeological theory, and our method courses on field methods of data recovery. All of these courses intersect in the archaeological laboratory where data interpretations are made and new information about the past takes shape. In addition to contributing to both the BA and BS undergraduate majors and minors, this course will also provide a framework for training graduate students who enter the program with minimal field and laboratory training in archaeology."
ANTH 429: Paleoethnobotany,"Introductory course in paleoethnobotany, the study of the interrelationships between people of the past, natural environment, and plant resources.   Paleoethnobotany (3)This course is a survey of the fast-developing field of paleoethnobotany-- also known as ""archaeobotany"" or ""phytoarchaeology""-- that involves the extension of ethnobotany into the past, emphasizing archaeological plant remains and study of the historical dimensions, complex dynamics, and myriad interrelations between people and plant resources. The primary goals of the course are 1) to promote understanding of the vital interplay between the natural environment and human societies, with their diverse systems of belief and resource use, especially those of the past but with relevance to the present; and 2) to foster an appreciation for what modern paleoethnobotany involves as a subdiscipline or specialization in archaeology, related to both anthropology and the plant sciences. The course begins by considering the history and nature of the field, including parallel developments in plant biology. The first half of the semester entails weekly sessions that focus attention on the plant organism, sources of archaeobotanical data, taphonomic issues, and the major classes of archaeobotanical materials. Fundamental issues involved in fieldwork, and the variety of laboratory concerns and methodologies specific to paleoethnobotany as whole and with regard to individual subareas are addressed. Individual laboratory sessions highlight the different preservation states that affect ancient plant materials, as well as methods of identification and analysis. In the second half of the semester, attention is focused on theory and application, issues central to and/or addressed by paleoethnobotany as a subdiscipline of archaeological anthropology. The course follows a seminar style, with substantial participation by students, including individual presentations, laboratory study, and analysis. Learning is augmented and enhanced by use of various visual aids, along with modern comparative specimens and actual archaeological plant remains.  will fulfill 3 credits of the additional courses in the Anthropology minor and majors. ANTH 2 is a prerequisite."
ANTH 430: Ancient Brews,"Understanding how past humans altered their environments is at the core of this Ancient Brews course. Through the domestication of plants and animals to the continuous modification of technologies, our ancestors have successfully produced a wide range of alcoholic beverages. In ANTH430, we will recreate several alcohols (e.g., beer, cider, and wine) using the most basic methods through a process of experimental archaeology. From harvesting corn, apples, and grapes from Penn State¿s agricultural fields, to crushing barley with grinding stones, to cooking the ingredients in clay pots, the students will get firsthand experience with several ancient methods of alcohol production. Most of the semester is seminar-style, where we discuss journal articles relating to specific anthropological approaches to the evolution of alcohol."
ANTH 434N: Black Ecologies,"African and African Diasporic peoples have been central to the creation and transformation of global ecologies and landscapes. As the birthplace of humankind, the African continent features the longest archaeological record in the world, with abundant, yet often underrepresented, material and historical evidence for remarkable Indigenous African innovations in the areas of technology, food production, and resource and land use. This course specifically examines Black ecologies preceding and then radically transformed by the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, the enslavement of millions of Africans and their forced translocation to the Americas and Caribbean precipitated ecological transformations on all sides of the Atlantic, as African peoples, knowledge, resources and ecological inheritances were appropriated by the European mercantile system. Enslaved Africans transformed American landscapes via extractive industries of plantations and mines and suffered the emergence of toxic landscapes and disease alongside Native American communities. Africans also recreated African ecologies as they created livelihoods and landscapes of resistance and freedom in the Americas. The legacies of the Atlantic Era maintain a persistent dynamic in which African and African Diasporic communities experience disproportionate burdens of environmental injustice today. The concept of Black ecologies reflects the marginality, systemic racism and dispossession experienced by Black peoples and their landscapes. Black ecologies also allow us to understand African and African Diasporic ecological innovations, resistance and resilience, and the pathways to future sustainability and justice they promise."
ANTH 460: Human Genetics,"This course will cover the nature and contents of the human genome and the basic principles of evolution. We will also explore the future implications of personal genomics and how this information is being used to reconstruct our evolutionary history and to advance human medicine. We will carefully consider the processes by which we can identify how information contained within our genomes may affect physical and behavioral phenotypes, and what other factors may be involved (e.g., the environment). The points will be illustrated by a variety of examples of human evolution and important biomedical issues"
ANTH 461: Molecular Anthropology,"Provides framework to understand current issues in biology, genetics, and anthropology as they relate to the evolution of our species.   Molecular Anthropology (3) The aim of this course is to provide students with the framework to understand current issues in biology, genetics, and anthropology as they relate to the evolution of our species. Basic methods in molecular biology, structure of the genome, molecular evolution, and human population genetics will be covered in the first part of the course. Once these tools are in place we will examine both classical and contemporary research reports on a number of topics, including the place of humans among the apes; mitochondrial Eve, DNA in forensics; Neandertal DNA and other applications of ancient DNA; reconstructing recent human evolution' the biological meaning of race; disease gene mapping; recent technological advances in genomics; skin, hair, and eye color genes; and the genetic future of our species. There will be three exams that will each count for 25% of the grade. Attendance and participation are mandatory and will count for 25% of the final grade. A portion of this participation grade is earned by presenting 10 min. summaries of particular readings. Each student will be expected to summarize a scientific paper four times during the semester. These summaries are not expected to be exhaustive reports on the material, but should reflect an effort on the part of the student to understand and discuss the material and may require some background work."
ANTH 470: Our Place in Nature,"An in-depth consideration of humanity's behavioral origins as biological beings through natural selection.   Honors Our Place in Nature (3) The title ""Our Place in Nature"" takes off from T.H. Huxley's famous book in 1863 that put humans in rather than outside of nature, and the idea of the course is to place humans in the context of organic evolution both specifically and as a kind of general ""model"" organism (for example, genomic, phylogenetic, and comparative perspectives will be included). We will take a theme (one or more related topics, depending on enrollment, timeliness, etc.), which students will be assigned to work on singly or in groups. We'll first read from the historical, comparative, and evolutionary literature to see how ""Our Place in Nature"" relative to that theme, was first argued. Then we will follow the literature in evolutionary, developmental and genetic biology to the present to see how our current understanding of the trait evolved. Current research, especially on developmental and genetic aspects of the trait, will be examined in depth. We'll pay special attention to research strategies, comparative and genomic approaches, and latent working assumptions that help or hinder our explanations. The sociocultural context will be considered throughout, including the implications for society of our changing scientific assessment of the trait.As an Honors course, we will have the time, and the students the dedication, to pursue the chosen topic(s) in much greater and more rigorous detail than is possible in the usual lecture or even seminar course formats. The students who enroll for this course will be given a description of the approach and the intended general topic, on a course web page or by email when I learn they have registered. Requisite background reading will be identified so students will know what will be expected of them. Some prior reading will be assigned, so that we can begin the semester with a common basis in background. The course will assume the level of knowledge such as can be obtained in one of several recent ""Evolution"" texts, an understanding of modern genetics and genetic methodology, basic statistics, and a general work on the history and philosophy of science and evolutionary thinking (initially, probably J.A. Moore's Science as a Way of Knowing). This substantial background requirement is based on this being an upper-level class; for good students to get what good students deserve at a good university, we need to be able to start at a high level.Evaluation will stress original synthetic thought and investigation rather than memorized factual recapitulation. Work groups will tackle particular problems, present them, and turn in written products. There will be a written take-home synthetic essay exam. There will be other written assignments summarizing assigned reading or topics to keep students on track. The class will generally be based on oral discussion and/or be run in Socratic Q&A format. Evaluation will include a major component related to attendance and to level and quality of in- class participation, acquired knowledge and quality of thought and communication. This course will build on, and incorporate, knowledge acquired in physical anthropology, evolutionary biology, statistics, and genetics courses and will count as 3 credits toward the additional courses in biological anthropology required for the Anthropology major."

APLNG 250: Peer Tutoring for Multilingual Writers,"This class provides theoretical and practical training to prepare Writing Center Peer Tutors with specific expertise in tutoring international/multilingual students. This course provides a theoretically-grounded introduction to the principles and practices of peer tutoring with multilingual writers (writers for whom English is not a first language). It is designed specifically for undergraduate students who wish to be employed as Peer Tutors with Penn State Learning at the Writing Center. Like , the class provides a basic orientation to the techniques of being an effective writing tutor, but offers a deeper understanding of the issues faced by writers whose first language is not English. The class may be of particular interest to students who study languages or education, who plan to work in academia, or who have a strong interest in cross-cultural communication or international education. However, undergraduate students of any major and of any language background are welcome to enroll in this course. Drawing upon research in second language acquisition, instructional theory, and composition pedagogy, the class examines the central roles of identity, belief, and cultural perspective in the development of tutoring expertise. Exploring the student's own development as a writer and learner, engaging in practical training activities, writing intensively, talking about writing, and engaging in reflective exercises comprise the first set of topics in the semester. In the second unit, through readings, interaction, observation and discussion, each tutor-in-training will explore the cultural and linguistic factors in the development and maintenance of second-language writing proficiency for international students in an American university context. There is a strong focus as well on tutoring pedagogy, and the class includes a 10-week structured practicum experience during which each student will tutor an ESL student from a first-year writing class (). Students who want to work as Peer Tutors must have completed their own first-year writing requirement; it is recommended that they have completed ENGL 202 also."
APLNG 280N: Conducting International Comparative Research,"Conducting International Comparative Research. (3) (Gen Ed;IL; Integrative) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements and may also serve as a methods course in the Global and International Studies (GLIS) major. The goal of this course is to equip students with effective methods for conducting international and cross-cultural research that addresses issues and problems occasioned by an increasingly globalized world. Students will acquire the background knowledge and skills necessary to analyze and evaluate existing international comparative literature and to design and propose new cross-national and cross-cultural research. The course focuses on projects in five key, contemporary domains of globalization: human rights, culture and identity, global conflict, wealth and inequality, and health and environment, and it draws on multidisciplinary methods from across the humanities and social sciences - including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Particular attention is paid to working with international datasets and the issue of translation and interpretation. As a result of the course, students will be able to: (1) locate and understand the structure and import of existing international databases, (2) design comparative, cross-national and cross-cultural research projects, (3) evaluate the validity, reliability, and significance of published international comparative research, (4) conduct basic comparative analyses of social, political, and cultural texts (documents) and oral interview data and other audio and visual data, (5) evaluate comparative quantitative data from cross-cultural surveys and other quantitative instruments, and (6) design reports and multimedia presentations of international comparative research."

"APLNG 310: Language Rights, Policy, and Planning","This is a course on language rights, policy, and planning from individual, group, inter-ethnic, and national perspectives. Linguistic minorities are a consequence of colonization by European powers in different regions of the globe. Other effects of colonization and political conflicts include mass movement, migration, and the emergence of nationalism. In such contexts, minorities have made demands for language rights and used language policy and planning as strategies to realize demands for social justice. This course will examine how linguistic minorities secure opportunities to use their own languages and have them accommodated in official legislation as mother tongue, second, or foreign languages. The course will adopt a global perspective and analyze language rights as well as language policy and planning in diverse regions of the globe, including but not restricted to, Africa, Asia, and South America. Analysis will primarily focus on how language policies can be carried out from different perspectives (e.g., literary, linguistic, and political) in different geographical regions. After examining how language policies operate in and influence society, the course will use sociopolitical ideologies to explore the nature of the relationship between language policies and language rights and the ways this relationship enables one to achieve an expanded understanding of the impact of language policies and language rights on local language practices."

ARCH 170N: Introduction to Sustainable Architecture,"US buildings account for almost 40% of national CO2 emissions, 39% of the US total energy consumption, and 60% of US electricity alone. Worldwide, buildings consume nearly 40% of the world's energy, 25% of its wood, and 15% of its water. Building construction and use contribute significantly to global climate change. The way we design our built environment has a significant impact on consumption statistics, which is why we must consider the global environmental and health effects of buildings during the planning, design, and construction process. This course provides a broad exploration of the art and science of sustainable architecture. Architecture produces cultural artifacts with meaning. Yet, inhabiting and using architecture has a distinct and measurable impact on both local and global environments. Scientifically, this course investigates passive and active energy systems for buildings, environmental components of material production and use, and site and building design effects on the water cycle, clean air, local ecosystems, and food production. Students will calculate energy consumption and generation scenarios, produce a life-cycle analysis of a familiar product, evaluate a building based on current green building certification strategies, and evaluate biological impacts over the local and regional scale. Aesthetically, this course investigates vernacular solutions to physical human comfort, and demonstrates the artistic and cultural place of architecture in society. Part of the course will trace historical aesthetic trends to better understand how the existing unsustainable path began. Students will understand the roles of multiple stakeholders/social actors in every building project-from owners, to global ""neighbors"". Together, the course highlights the intersection of building performance and aesthetics. There will be a focus on returning to traditional solutions, as well as capitalizing on new innovations to solve environmental challenges. The underlying theme will be flourishing-both reducing negative environmental impacts as well as celebrating the healthy human condition through artistic expression and aegis of architecture."

ARCH 232: Architectural Design II,"Design of limited environments within defined constraints.  Architectural Design II (6) The second-year design curriculum emphasis is on introducing the student to the complexity of the architectural whole. The curriculum bridges the abstract design principles taught in the first year and the ability to put together a large building, the focus in the third-year. The objectives are to create an understanding of architectural elements and develop a sensitivity and awareness required for valid interpretations as well as to develop a reflective and critical design process with emphasis on the individual ability to articulate ideas. The major means of accomplishing the design process is through the design of smaller buildings/environments. To introduce the pragmatic and expressive aspects of architectural design and integrate visual communication with the design process. The emphasis is on developing comprehensive architectural thought, on the foundations of skill and knowledge essential for designing more ""complex"" buildings in later years, and on making the students aware of the multiplicity of factors involved in the design process and their civic responsibility in making informed choices. Thus, the pervasive issue of meaning in architecture is given a high priority and is interwoven in all stages of design exploration."

ARCH 317: Theory of Modern Japanese Architecture,"Introduction to the development of modern Japanese architecture from the Meiji Restoration of 1868 to the present day.   Theory of Modern Japanese Architecture (3) outlines a lineage of ideology in Japanese architectural discourse in order to examine reciprocal interactions between Japan and the West in the development of modern Japanese architecture from the Meiji Period (1868-1912), through the Metabolism of the 60's, to the present day. The concept of ""tradition"" itself is an invention of the Meiji (modern) era. Through this notion, the course will introduce students to crucial moments in the development of Japanese architecture, while making parallel references to the key developments in the West. Inversely, examples of traditional Japanese architecture will be introduced as counterpoint for the modern. Several topics such as the evolution of Japanese symbolic and spatial traditions in art, architecture, and landscape architecture (gardens) will be discussed. While discussing the evolution of Japanese culture, aesthetics and religions, the influences of China and Korea will be introduced, thus increasing students' familiarity to the East. A brief examination of Western architects paralleling the course content will also be presented. The key figures to be discussed during the class include Kenzo Tange, Kisho Kurokawa, Arata Izozaki, Fumihiko Maki, Tadao Ando, Shin Takamatsu, Toyo Ito, Kazuyo Sejima and Shigeru Ban. Key Western architects, including Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Le Corbusier, will also be discussed. In addition, several broad themes such as geography, climate culture, and symbolic and spatial traditions in art will be introduced. Eastern values and ethics very incongruent from those of the West and their impact on architecture will be presented and discussed. Specific globalization, the resultant reciprocal and transformative cross-cultural interactions in the development of modern Japanese architecture, and the unique process of ""Japanization"" in which ideas from the West are adapted, refined, and absorbed into Japanese architecture through specific buildings and architects. Students in this course will be expected to become more familiar with Eastern culture; comprehend basic principles behind Japanese architecture and gardens; understand relevant terminology associated with Japanese culture, art, gardens, and architecture; and become more aware of the reciprocal and transformative cross-cultural interactions in architecture."
ARCH 380: Building Environmental Systems I,"Building Environmental Systems I (3) introduces Architecture students to the topics of building thermal environment, and passive and mechanical heating/cooling systems.

ARCH 481: Digital Design Media,"Advanced course in digital modeling, rendering, animation and non-linear video for architectural investigations."
ARCH 482: Foundations in Shape Grammars,"Shape grammars are a powerful formalism for the generative description of designs and a key discourse in design computation. The formalism is distinctive for its interest in developing a mathematics of design through visual computations described directly with geometry. By foregrounding visual representations and visual processes, the formalism lays the foundation for shape computations that aid in explaining, understanding, and developing designs specified by rule-based, generative systems. These computations provide the basis for the generative description, interpretation, and evaluation of visual designs. This course provides a broad exploration of shape grammar theory, implementations, and applications in a variety of disciplines. More specifically, it investigates the theory of shapes, shape rules, parametric shape rules, rule schemata, languages of designs, and more, providing students with a foundation in the rule-based analysis and specification of designs as well as a fundamental understanding on design computing. It considers the history and logic of spatial systems in the arts, architecture, and engineering to build an awareness of rule-based approaches in design, especially in relation to the theories underlying contemporary design software. Critical and creative applications in the arts, architecture, landscape, urbanism, product design, and engineering will be discussed to understand shape grammars as a visual approach to rule-based analysis and synthesis with broad potential for design and research. Building on these insights, students will learn to analyze designs with rules and use those rules to generate new design configurations. Students will also be challenged to develop their own rulebased interpretations of design processes to study how shape grammars can be understood as a generative design methodology."
ARCH 499F: Architectural Design Foreign Study,"The abroad design studio serves students in their fifth year of the BARCH program, giving them the option of studying abroad for a semester additional to their required Rome semester. This studio will provide our students with a much  needed global perspective into architecture and urbanity as practiced elsewhere in the world. The Architectural Design Studio will be embedded in an urban location abroad, introducing students to the socio-cultural and urban-architectural  forces that shape our globe. It is increasingly important to recognize different models of architectural practice within different global contexts, and this studio will permit our students to engage in these issues first hand by being immersed  within a particular culture and designing for it. A semester in an abroad studio is not merely a travel experience, but an academic exploration of a global environment. Students are expected to approach the work of the semester with even more rigor than they would a semester at home, while they follow a similar semester structure. The abroad studio will involve a site in the host city, programs and infrastructure appropriate for the exploration of the new context. The  semester will include an initial urban/architectural analysis of the host city, leading to the identification of sites and design research topics. The studio will continue with the introduction of programs, and additional infrastructural  requirements, and will culminate with a building proposal within the context of the host city. The abroad studio will have 150 contact hours, similar to architectural design studios at home"

ART 51N: Meteorology and Visual Arts: To Know is to See,"This course examines the inter-relationship between what we know and what we see, through an introductory exploration of art and science. Engaging students in the study of weather formation, mainly clouds, artistic depictions within the genre of landscape, and the expressed practice of painting; fosters the development of observational skills necessary for reading the landscape and interpreting collected data. What we know and what we see is an on-going evolution of development; syncing the old with the new. Therefore, observation and interpretation are essential to critical thinking, making the intersection between art and science a fertile ground for discovery and learning. The exciting part of the course is the large amount of overlap in the general ideas and thought processes used in meteorology and art, especially when using clouds as the connective tissue. Scientists and artists are both detail oriented and worry about the quality of their work. Both involve collecting data to find the best approaches to a problem, and reasoning through challenges that arise. Students will be challenged throughout the course to seek these connections and how perspectives from each discipline inform the other. Meteorology and art have long been aligned in a common quest to understand how the world works, each seeking interpretations and explanations using a range of complementary and contrasting practices and perspectives. Clouds come in a vast array of sizes and shapes, and are depicted in art using a variety of techniques, creating a shared focus for a deeper understanding of both areas of endeavor. Students will learn about the concept of mixing, which is important to cloud formation and to painting. Students will conduct experiments to learn about cloud processes, and will learn and practice artistic techniques to convey atmospheric conditions. Ideas from both perspectives will be integrated in analysis and discussion. Data from instruments and the individual artist will be collected, shared, and analyzed. Learning how clouds form will help with painting, and questions and perspectives that arise from painting will increase the understanding of cloud processes. The common threads in this approach are a curious mind, a strong detail-oriented focus, effective communication, and respect for the creative tension between ambiguity and assurance in the search for a better sense of causes, connections, and incessant changes."

ARTH 220Z: Chinese Art - Linked,"A general survey of the great periods of Chinese art from the Shang dynasty until the modern period.  Chinese Art - Linked (3) (GA;IL)(BA)  provides an introduction to the art of China from the Neolithic period through the twentieth century. Emphasis will be placed on the major dynastic periods (Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Ming, Yuan, and Qing); however, regional developments throughout China are examined as well. Students are introduced to a variety of artistic traditions and media, including jades, bronzes, ceramics, sculpture, painting, and architecture. The course is designed to meet two principal goals. The first is to develop skills of visual analysis and a critical vocabulary for discussing the media, technologies, styles, compositions and iconographies of Chinese art. The second is to foster an understanding of art--and visual culture in general--according to social, economic, political, and religious contexts. Key topics include: the ritual use of objects, patronage, issues of reception and aesthetics, Buddhist art, the organization and use of sacred space, depictions of gender, and regional developments/interactions. Requirements include essay exams and at least one paper. As a general education course, this class provides an introduction to Chinese art for students of any major.

ARTH 222Q: Intersections between Art History and the History of Psychology,"ART H 222Q: Intersections between Art History and Psychology Why is there a cultural association between mental illness and artistic creation? What is the history of this association? Is there a psychological foundation for it or is it a cultural stereotype with no basis in reality? To address these questions this course will explore the integrated histories of modern psychology and avant-garde art from the late 19th century to the present, comparing the different approaches to the topic in the disciplines of art history and psychology. We will discuss the possible benefits and drawbacks of each approach. By celebrating genius, art history has often been complicit in perpetuating the stereotype of the ""mad"" artist, even romanticizing it and discounting the reality of disease; whereas psychologists often view images as symptoms, misinterpreting the art historical context in which artists work. Interestingly, avant-garde art has often been associated with ""insanity"" with both negative and positive connotations. As a history of art and psychology course, the syllabus is organized as a chronological survey focusing on points of intersection between avant-garde art and psychology. Many of these points will be the lives and works of individual artists who either suffered mental illness, such as Vincent van Gogh, or engaged with psychology and mental illness as the subject of their art, as did Edvard Munch, the creator of the famous image, The Scream. In each case it is interesting to look at the reciprocity between the two disciplines: how the artists represented mental illness and transformed psychological theories into visual art and how psychologists and the medical establishment have responded to these artists, using them as diagnostic subjects. We will look specifically at bi-polar disorder and the psychological debates surrounding its relationship to artistic creativity. We will also look at larger avant-garde movements such as Expressionism and Surrealism, movements inspired by therapeutic practices, the art of mental patients, and psychoanalytic theory. We will look at the legacy of each of these movements in contemporary avant-garde art, including attitudes toward Outsider or Visionary artists and modern art therapy. Particular emphasis will be placed on psychoanalytic theory. Sigmund Freud's interest in art impacted his work and has rendered his writings conducive to artistic interpretation even today, although his theories have been rejected by many contemporary psychologists. We will look at artists who directly responded to Freud's writings such as Max Ernst and Salvador Dali, female surrealists such as Leonora Carrington, and issues surrounding ""hysteria"" as it was adopted by both male and female surrealists as a model for creative expression, and which continues to inform feminist art practices today. While contemporary avant-garde artists continue to respond to various psychological theories and practices, contemporary psychologists use formal analysis to understand the art of mental patients and employ artistic practices in the development of modern art therapy."
ARTH 224N: Authors and Artists,"This course explores the many links between modern art and literature, including fiction about artists, illustrations of fiction and poetry, efforts to write in the styles associated with modern art, and practices of ekphrasis (the evocation of visual art in language). These links between authors and artists have exerted a formative influence on the development of modern fiction and poetry as authors and artists in various avant-garde groupings collaborated and competed to generate modes of artistic expression appropriate to modernity. This course examines those interactions. Course objectives are to bring together for comparative examination: * Formal or generic relationships between texts and images at particular historical moments; under this rubric we will consider issues such as ekphrasis. * Creative collaboration and cross-pollination between writers and artists, which have been crucially important in the history of literature and poetry; examples include Pre-Raphaelite poetry and painting, Virginia Woolf and Post-Impressionism, Gertrude Stein and Cubism * Conceptions of creativity as these have been expressed by writers using the figure of the artist; texts in this category range from Balzac's The Unknown Masterpiece, through Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, to Paul Auster's appropriation from the performance artist Sophie Calle This course explores the ways knowledge of literature and skills in critical reading can be rewardingly brought to bear on the visual arts, and considers how visual art can illuminate the workings of literature both for individual readers and in the classroom."
ARTH 250: A Chronological Survey of Photography,"A survey of photography's place and influence in a social, cultural, and historical context.  ART H 250 A Chronological Survey of Photography (3) This course explores the role played by photography over time in providing understanding and insight in a social, cultural, and historical context of the impact of the development of the photographic medium and its effect on social, political, cultural and technological events. Emphasis will be given to understanding the context that surrounds the scientific and aesthetic development of photography. This is a survey of the chronology of events in western culture that transpires from the inception of photography until the year 2000. It includes the influences and outcomes of photographers and those associated with the medium on our culture. Emphasis will be placed on the influence of photography on the world around it, and significant events and individuals in the development of the medium as a vital art form. The structure of the course will consist of research and discussion of events and individuals that characterized years selected for examination. Each week one or two decades of western culture will be highlighted. Although the thrust of research will relate to photographic subject matter, the events studied will span the culture. We will explore the development of art, literature, music, and photography, as well as, historic landmarks, and the events that have shaped present society. Each week a selection of visual material will be presented highlighting selected events, students will read literature from the period of discussion, significant pieces of music will be introduced, and accounts of periodic events will be surveyed.Each week, a group of students will be assigned to research at least one decade. Each student will gather information about a significant figure or event that occurred in the course of a given period. The student will be expected to prepare a short paper and give a five-minute oral presentation about his/her assigned year, historical figure or event. As each student presents, the chronology of events becomes clear and the multiple threads of history weaves a brilliant tapestry of our culture. For the final presentation the student will prepare a ten-page research paper about a historical figure or event.Students will be graded on the quality of the weekly oral presentations and the demonstrated level of commitment to research. Another significant part of their grade will be derided from the length of committed scholarship given to the ten-page term paper. Students must exhibit a level of originality, clarity, and insight. The student must demonstrate the capacity for the assimilation of facts and events relative to their subject and demonstrate how their subject relates to other events that occurred around the same time of their event. Toward this end students will be encouraged to work together to illustrate the interconection of the chronology."

"ARTH 306: Color across Cultures: A Global History of Pigments, Dyes, Metals and Other Colorants in Art","Color across Cultures offers an introduction to color from the perspective of global art history. Through documents, art works and specimens of historic colorants, we will explore geological and mineral sources of mined pigments, as well as natural sources of historic dyes; students will learn techniques for identifying many such mineral and organic sources of color in works of art. We will browse a global variety of artists' recipe books for making pigments, and we will attempt to recreate a few of their colors. We will explore the ritual use of colorants, such as ochre (which, in early indigenous cultures of North America, was turned red with fire and then used to paint images of fire deities), ""Maya blue"" (which was used to paint both votive objects and victims of blood sacrifice), or vermilion (a red used to represent the transformative blood of Christ in medieval art because it was made through transformative alchemy). We will consider the economics of color: the capacity of purple dye to signify royalty in the pre-modern Mediterranean world, the global traffic of color-making technologies along the Silk Road, and the colonial exploitation of coloring resources (most notably in the case of enslaved populations forced to cultivate indigo for British trade in the 18th century). Students will gain an introduction to different color theories, from Sir Isaac Newton's light-refraction theory, to Goethe's emphasis on the instability of retinal color, to Thomas Young and Sir James Clerk Maxwell's RGB vision models; artistic uses and responses to such theories will be explored. We will also examine different color organization systems (the rainbow, the palette, color wheels, the Munsell system, Pantone, Hexcode numbers) from which artists have drawn their ideas about color. Among such color-organization systems, we will also explore the many, frequently problematic attempts to delineate biological species and races using color as a criterion."

For example, students will have an opportunity to engage with African American artists such as Keith Obadike, whose on-line performances include an attempt to put his ""blackness"" up for sale on ebay.com in August of 2001. Students may also look at the ways in which net.art (Art made to be viewed on the internet) can critique commercial cooptation of global culture: etoy.com, for example, is an international and collaborative artist's group that satirizes global capital by camouflaging itself as a multinational corporation.This class will depend largely upon written responses and class discussion, rather than upon tests. Thus, students will learn how to approach difficult theoretical sources that have been assigned to them, and they will learn how to ask the kinds of questions that will help them understand such sources. This course will emphasize critical thinking rather than memorization, so students will develop analytical skills that will be useful in many other contexts. Because students will be given weekly writing assignments, they will be able to improve their skills in composition."

ASIA 103: Introduction to Hinduism,"Historical overview of the development of ideas that forms the basis of the south Asian religious culture.  /  Introduction to Hinduism (3) (GH;IL)(BA). This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. We begin with a discussion of the pre­-Vedic Indus Valley civilization reflecting upon its influence on later south Asian cultures. The course then traces how the Vedic ritual tradition, and the Vedantic philosophy gave rise to the concepts of Karma (individual action and its underlying motives), Samsara (the cyclical view of life), and the Atman (nature of the individual). Moreover, we pause here to explore the relationship between the emerging idea of civic responsibility (Dharma) and its relationship to the Vedic and Vedantic thought. Next we examine how the Vedantic philosophical tradition may have incorporated a diversity of philosophical views including both Brahmanical as well as non-­Brahmanical traditions of Buddhism, Jainism, Lokayata, etc. The class will read excerpts from the religious literature of the era. The first part of the course concludes with selected readings from the Bhagavadgita, Mahabharata, as well as some Buddhist and Jaina texts. All of these readings will be in English. Class discussions focus on how the classical Hindu worldview may have emerged from the philosophical foundation of the Vedantas, and later built the groundwork for the Hindu Bhakti (devotion) movements. The second part of the course focuses on the various regional Bhakti traditions from the middle ages onwards, analyzing how the regional cultures may have related with the great classical Brahmanic tradition. The course concludes with a discussion of how Hinduism in the post 1800s responded to the forces of colonization, exploring how the different religious and cultural traditions of south Asia may have interacted with other religious cultures (both indigenous and foreign) like Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, and Christianity. We shall read excerpts from noteworthy thinkers and writers of nineteenth and twentieth century to understand the very interesting dynamics between religion and civil society of more recent times.

This course will examine the place of culture in international history through a comparative look at the role of cultural circulation and exchange in relations among China, Korea, and Japan (and between East Asia and the West) from the propagation of Buddhism in the first century A.D. to present-day circulation of popular music, movies, and comics. We will explore the international politics of culture and the politics of international culture, considering questions of what constitutes culture, whether it is ever entirely separate from politics, and how that separation has evolved over time. These larger themes of the course will be tackled by following the historical movement of concrete objects and people throughout the region. This is a course in international history, but it also seeks to explore aspects of international relations. The goals of the class are not only to gain an understanding of the uses and impact of culture in international relations, but also to develop the skill of building such an understanding through primary and secondary sources, both written and visual. Students in this class will think critically about assigned texts to develop their own interpretations of their meanings. Through readings, discussions, presentations, and the final project, students will enhance their ability to think critically and to express their ideas clearly in both speech and writing. Class work includes some lecture but emphasizes guided discussions, group work, writing exercises, and some student presentations. This participatory approach is intended to deepen students' appreciation of the assigned readings, to help them understand value systems that may differ from those predominant in western cultures, and to assist students in developing both analytic and expressive abilities."

The Chinese Rhetorical Tradition (3 per semester/maximum of 6) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course surveys the Chinese rhetorical tradition dating back two and a half millennia. Rhetoric is defined here as the study and practice of artful means of communication, including poetic, expository, and argumentative modes. The class will first delve into the works of competing intellectual schools in pre-imperial China (pre-221 BCE), which set a corner stone for thoughts and practice of communication in the imperial period (221 BCE - 1918). These schools, including the Daoist, the Confucian, and the Legalist, developed their rhetorical notions through engaging with the political, intellectual, and ethnic Other. From here the class will examine the multiple facets of modern Chinese rhetoric, which has undergone a continual contact and conflation with other rhetorical traditions in the global contact zone. The class will focus on topics such as feminist discourse, Chinese-American rhetoric, and the teaching of writing, which bear direct implications on our contemporary social life."
ASIA 424: Transnational Korean Literature,"Exploration of seminal Korean texts, including poetry, fiction, autobiography, and criticism, from the early twentieth century to the contemporary era. This course provides a comprehensive overview of modern Korean literature within a transnational context. As we learn how to critically analyze seminal Korean texts, we will locate them in the social, political, economic, and cultural conditions under which they were produced and received. In grappling with some of the fundamental issues they raise;including colonialism, migration, national division, war, gender relations, developmentalism, urbanization, democratization, and contemporary consumer culture;we will also seek to situate these writings in the Korean vernacular within the larger context of global modernity. Rather than take Korean literature and global modernity as given or apart from each other, we will attend to their intersections by raising such questions as: How did modern experiences, constructed through the interface with unfamiliar Others, change preexisting ways of writing and reading? How did foreign occupations affect the formation of a national literature? In what ways do Korean writers' representations of the inter/national events and phenomena on and beyond the Korean peninsula at once enrich and complicate empirical investigations into modern histories of Korea, East Asia, and the world? In an increasingly borderless world, can we draw a boundary around what is called ""Korean"" literature? In parallel with these questions, we will further discuss why and how to engage in literary practices in the current age of digital reproduction. Instruction and all materials will be in English. No preliminary knowledge of Korean history or language is required for taking this course."

ASIA 434: Beyond Anime,"The visual, tactile, and literary arts play key roles in how modern nation-states make sense of themselves and how they make sense of other nations. Japan provides one key example through which to observe the use and function of art to create not only the image and identity of a nation and national culture, but also the image and identity of other national cultures. In recent years, Japanese popular culture has been reborn around the world. A global generation has grown up watching anime and reading manga in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and English. Beyond Anime is designed to contextualize the recent appropriation and dissemination of Japanese popular culture through the cyclical history of such appropriations through the modern period. In this way, the course will explore the precursors, antecedents, and contexts to our present cultural moment. Through film, photography, posters, matchbook-labels, textiles, industrial design, novels, and myriad other popular media, this seminar-style study of Japanese popular visual culture will help students see Japanese visual arts in terms that are local to Japanese aesthetics and through those that transcend local cultures. Drawing on the long history of illustrated narrative from scrolls to chapbooks, through film and photo essay, this course confronts the exoticist notion that Japan's arts have always placed a disproportionately heavy emphasis on the visual. Through comparative readings of cultural and visual material from Japan, this course will raise questions of aesthetic, cultural, and national difference. Specific topics will vary with instructor, but may include: the rendering of three dimensional space through perspective, the use of pictures in the service of narrative versus the use of pictures as narrative, and how notions of negative space promise deep insight and risk crass stereotypes."

The course presents a survey of ancient Greek history and culture beginning with the Bronze Age palace-states of Crete and Mycenae, examines the emergence of Greek city-states, notably Athens and Sparta, traces their transformation through conflicts among themselves and with the Persian empire, and describes their eventual eclipse by the kingdom of Macedon. Since this course treats the beginnings of historical writing among the Greeks, students learn to evaluate diverse historical texts and their relationship to legend, myth, and poetry. The nature of historical thought itself is emphasized throughout the course. Also emphasized is the debate between the egalitarian Justice of democracy, the sober wisdom of oligarchy, and the overwhelming power of monarchy, as experienced by the Greeks down to the end of the fourth century B.C.E."
CAMS 104: Ancient Egypt,"This course will track the history of Egypt, the first nation state in the world, covering a time span of over 3,000 years. The investigation of the history will focus primarily on the major players (i.e. the pharaohs themselves) and the political events that shaped their reigns. Its history involves not only the Nile Valley, but also that of the entire northeast African continent and lands of Western Asia. The magnificent ruins and artifacts that have survived offer the student a visual examination of the ancients and will provide illustration to a great extent of the specific time periods and dramatic incidents. The student will also be confronted at every turn by textual sources (in translation) and the archaeological evidence. The latter will be addressed at length with introduction to archaeological expeditions. This will serve to teach the student the contribution of archaeological method and interpretation in the knowledge and understanding of the history of the Near East."
CAMS 105: History of the Ancient Near East,"History of the Ancient Near East from the end of the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period.  History of the Ancient Near East (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The objective of this course is to introduce the student to the history of Ancient Near Eastern societies. The geographic areas to be covered include Mesopotamia, Iran, Anatolia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt. This course will stress the variegated nature of civilizations in those geographic areas and focus on the written texts and material culture through which we can reconstruct the history of the Ancient Near East. This course complements similar introductory courses in ancient Mediterranean history and civilizations. This course satisfies major and minor requirements for programs of study in the Dept. of Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies. A special emphasis will be placed on those aspects that permit us to relate to the seemingly arcane mechanisms lying behind the social, religious, and political interactions which characterize the history of these civilizations, especially ideology, economy, and propaganda. Major figures and events will be presented as being as symptomatic of cultural or political trends."
CAMS 109Y: Writing Systems of the World,"This course aims at providing students with a thorough understanding of the role played by writing systems in the development of civilizations and the articulation of polities. The emphasis will be placed on historical, cultural, economic & religious matters. In order to fully comprehend the nature of these issues, the lion's share of the course will focus on the functions & the development of early writing in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and the Americas. Additional attention will be given to the history of early writing systems. We will examine how the writing systems in the Near East and East Asia originated and developed orthographic strategies & conventions to record the linguistic realities for which they were designed; what processes & mechanisms facilitated the creation of the first alphabet in the Ancient Near East; how modern scholars have been able to decipher scripts lost long ago (such as Egyptian hieroglyphs & Mesopotamian cuneiform), and how some decipherment processes are advancing & improving our knowledge of other civilizations (such as Maya hieroglyphs). The study of the social & cultural aspects of writing will be grounded in a diachronic approach. In that regard, the course will engage with a variety of historical concerns: the possible reasons for which certain cultures may have started to use writing for bureaucratic & economic reasons, whereas others (such as early China) would seem to have started to use it for rather more symbolic realms of life; and the relation between writing, identity, and script in different areas."
CAMS 110: Introduction to the Bible: Old Testament,"The Old Testament (or, Hebrew Bible) is the record of the interaction between the people of ancient Israel and their God. As a religious text, the Bible is inextricably intertwined with the cultures of Israel's neighbors, including the Canaanites, Syrians, Greeks, Assyrians, Babylonians, Arabs, Egyptians, and the peoples of the eastern desert. To study the Hebrew Bible and its development during the first millennium BCE is to study the history, culture, and literature of the entire region. This course introduces students to the literature of ancient Israel, its rituals, the stories which established a people's identity, and which defined their moral behavior. Great figures of the texts, such as Moses, David, Solomon, Bathsheba, Ruth, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezra, teach us important lessons about life and how people of faith attempted to relate to one another, to God, and to people outside their ethnic group. Students will read from the biblical text, as well as from secondary source readings which contains scholarly opinion from a variety of sources. Recent archaeological and epigraphical studies will be incorporated into the course to enhance our work. The ultimate goal will be to assess the meaning of the texts in their ancient Near Eastern environment; to understand the development of Hebrew religion and the beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism; and to understand the connection between biblical studies and other fields of study, such as History, Religious Studies, Archeology, Linguistics, and Comparative Literature."
CAMS 115: Literature of the Ancient Near East,"Reading and study of literary works from the Ancient Near East, especially from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. This course is designed to provide the student with both a basic knowledge of Ancient Near Eastern literature and the tools to appreciate it. It will present a wide sample of literary compositions from Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, along with some parallels from Ancient Anatolian and Syro-Palestinian traditions. Although mythology is not the main focus of the course, some mythological compositions will be read because of their literary fabric and epic structure. The course will be divided into two main sections: Mesopotamian and Egyptian literatures. Students will read some of the most famous literary compositions from the Ancient Near East (such as Gilgamesh and the Babylonian story of creation), as well as a representative sample of works from a wide variety of genres (love poetry, mythological narratives, laments, religious hymns, tales, wisdom literature). These compositions will be approached from a literary and aesthetic point of view, without neglecting the inherently problematic relation with their historical context (as in the case of compositions that mention actual historical characters, such as the legends of the Sargonic kings in Mesopotamia). Moreover, the works related to both official cult and popular religion (hymns, prayers, incantations, prophecies) will be read in their political, social, and religious context. In the limits between sacred and profane, our approach to love poetry will address some issues of ritual, gender, and sexuality. More strictly mundane genres (wisdom literature and humor) will show that some basic human concerns have remained unchanged. The course will provide students with a detailed overview of the main literary traditions and genres from the Ancient Near East, which played an essential role in the origins and shaping of the Bible as well as in some aspects of the Greek literary tradition Ci.e., the foundations of the Western understanding of literature and religious discourse."
CAMS 151: Introductory Biblical Hebrew,"Fundamentals of Biblical Hebrew grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.  J ST (CAMS/HEBR) 151 Introductory Biblical Hebrew (3) The aim of CAMS/J ST/ is to introduce students to the fundamentals of Biblical Hebrew as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Biblical Hebrew is the language in which the Old Testament was written, between the period of approximately 1200-200 B.C.E. This focuses primarily on the morphology and syntax of Biblical Hebrew. Drills on each point of grammar, as well as translation of sentences from Hebrew to English and English to Hebrew, and brief passages taken from the Bible are the basis of the student's homework throughout the semester. By the end of the semester, the students will be prepared to read short, unmodified passages of the Bible. The course will focus primarily on reading and writing, though students will read aloud in class regularly in order to ensure correct pronunciation and understanding. CAMS/J ST/ will prepare students to continue with CAMS/J ST/ and then 400-level courses.The course goals, in addition to providing the students with a firm grounding in Hebrew grammar and vocabulary, include giving the students a basic understanding of the history of the Biblical text. The primary focus will be on mastering paradigms and syntax, but the students will also be introduced to the Biblical texts themselves, which together from such an important piece of literature."
CAMS 15: Wonders of the Ancient World,"Overview of the ancient world by focusing on the famed ""Seven Wonders"" and similar achievements from 3000 B.C.E.-1st Century C.E. The core of this course is comprised of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: the Great Pyramid in Egypt, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos, the Statue of Zeus Olympios, the Mausoleum of Halikarnassos, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Throughout the semester other wondrous monuments and archaeological discoveries are covered as well. Depending on the expertise of the professor other archaeological sites and monuments may also include the Egyptian capital and reign of the Pharaoh Akhenaten and Nefertiti, the unplundered tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankamen, the Bronze Age Palaces of the Minoans of Crete and the Mycenaeans of mainland Greece, Troy, Shipwrecks of the Late Bronze Age, the mystery of the End of the Bronze Age, the Parthenon and Cult Statue of Athena on the Acropolis in Athens, the Temple of Zeus Olympios and athletic games at Olympia, Alexander the Great and his conquests in the East, the Royal Cemetery at Vergina and its unplundered tombs, and new explorations in Alexandria Egypt. If taught by an Egyptologist the course might include additional monuments and archaeological sites in Egypt, whereas if taught by a Near Eastern specialist the course might include additional monument and sites in the Near East."
CAMS 180: Ancient Warfare,"Historical survey of the evolution of warfare in the ancient Mediterranean region from prehistoric times to the Later Roman Empire.  CAMS (HIST) 180 Ancient Warfare (3) (GH;IL) Warfare has occupied a central place in the civilizations of the Mediterranean from the earliest times. The prehistoric origins of warfare is a hotly debated topic and constitutes the starting point for this course. Most scholars are agreed that military culture grew in step with sociopolitical development over the course of the third millennium BCE. In the following centuries, the Egyptians, and later the Assyrians and Persians, took great strides in developing sophisticated tactical systems, using infantry, chariotry, and cavalry. These matters occupy a little over the first third of the course. Across the Aegean Sea, Bronze Age (Mycenaean) Greece was ruled by elites occupying massively walled citadels, their leaders buried surrounded by their weapons. But how did these warriors fight? Do the epic poems of Homer memorialize Bronze Age combat? In the Archaic Period (700-500 BCE) infantry warfare in Greece was transformed by the appearance of the heavily-armored infantryman (the hoplite), deployed in a tight formation (the phalanx). The processes involved in the appearance of this kind of warfare, its nature, and its affects on Greek society and culture will be the focus of our attention for the second third of the course. On the periphery of the Mediterranean basin stood a variety of warrior cultures (the Scythians, Celts, or Germans). Numerous warrior-dominated polities vied with each other in Archaic Italy, but one of them, sitting on a ford of the river Tiber, ultimately rose to be the greatest military power produced by the ancient Mediterranean world: Rome. The Roman legions first won and then ensured the security of a Mediterranean-wide empire that stood for 700 years and evolved ultimately into world's first standing army of professional volunteers. The Roman military system holds our attention for the final third of the course. The course defines warfare broadly to include both tactical and strategic, as well as cultural and ideological, matters. Even this canvas is too vast to be surveyed in all its richness, so the major themes explored are: (i) what is war, where does it come from, and how did it change as civilization spread?; (ii) in what ways did warfare develop in the periods under study, in terms of strategy, tactics, and weapons technology?; (iii) how do different warfare practices reflect essential facets of the various cultures under consideration?"

CAMS 1: Greek and Roman Literature,"Greek and Roman Literature (3) (GH)(BA) This course surveys the traditions of classical literature exemplified by the masterworks of Greek and Roman authors. The choice of readings (in English translation) may vary from semester to semester, but the curriculum typically covers mythological epic (Homer, Virgil, and Ovid); tragedy (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Seneca); and comedy (Aristophanes and Plautus). The course may also examine minor poetic genres such as lyric, elegy, and satire; or the development of prose genres such as historiography, philosophical dialogue, rhetoric and oratory, and biography. The principal objective of  is to acquire knowledge of the story world of Greek and Roman literature, whose characters include the gods, goddesses, heroes, and heroines of classical mythology. A second objective is to understand the rules that govern the genres of Greek and Roman literature. Third, students learn how to interpret classical literature within its social and historical context as well as through the application of both ancient and modern literary theory.  is an introductory course that may be credited toward every Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies major, option, and minor.  meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements and is a General Education course in the Humanities (GH)."
CAMS 210: Numismatics and the Historian,"Numismatics--the scholarly study of coins and medals--is a major tool in the study of Classical history and archaeology.  CAMS (J ST) 210 Numismatics and the Historian (3) (GH;IL) WHY STUDY NUMISMATICS? Numismatics is the scholarly study of coins. Coinage has been used in the ancient world since the 7th century BCE. Eventually, minted money- i.e. coinage- came to supplant money in other forms, replacing barter as the primary means of exchange in economies around the world. Coinage became a tool of governments to impose taxation upon their subject peoples, and to spread propaganda about governmental goals or issues. Coins are works of art, but they are common, widely circulating ""works of art"" which also accomplish a daily monetary function to run commerce and the monetary system of an economy. Coins are also historical records, containing valuable information for the historian who is attempting to reconstruct the history of another time or place. For archaeologists, coins sometimes are the only means of providing absolute dates for excavated strata. The interpretation of numismatic evidence, like any other pieces of evidence in the historical puzzle, however, requires special knowledge and expertise.This course is not a course in ""coin collecting"", although the collector may find the course helpful or interesting. It is an investigation of the development of coined money in the ancient world, with special investigations into (1) how coins were struck and used in Phoenicia of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE; (2) the variety and early uses for coins in the Greek city states of the 6th-4th centuries BCE; (3) the development of Jewish coins in the Holy Land, from Persian times to the period of the 2nd Revolt (early 2nd century CE); and (4) the development of coinage in the Roman economy of the 1st-5th centuries CE.Photographs of coins will enhance class work. With the cooperation of the Palmer Museum, on Penn State's University Park Campus, the class will have access at several points during the semester to view and work with coins from the Palmer's collection of ancient Jewish coins Students will leave the course with a new understanding of what coins are, how they developed, and what they can teach us about ancient history and economics."
CAMS 430: Archaeology of the Near East,Culture of the Near East and India from Paleolithic times through the Bronze Age.
CAMS 432W: Gender and Sexuality in the Bible,"This writing intensive course will examine issues of gender and sexuality in the Bible, including the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the Deuterocanon, and the New Testament. It will introduce students to a variety of academic approaches to the Bible with respect to a broad range of topics. These topics include: gender identity, sexual orientation, sex, marriage and divorce, adultery, monogamy and polygyny, same-sex relations, chastity and celibacy, prostitution, gender violence, pornography, fertility, procreation, abortion, divine gender and sex, incest, and many others. In covering these themes, the course will deal with some of the most challenging and often disturbing stories and passages in the Bible, the ancient library of books that is sacred to Jews and Christians and which has otherwise greatly influenced civilization for more-or-less two thousand years. Alongside a close reading of the text (philology), this course will employ historical and literary criticism, investigations into ancient material culture (archaeology), modern theoretical interpretive approaches, reception theory, and other methodologies to examine not only the biblical writings in their ancient contexts, but their interpretation and use throughout history to construct social norms."
CAMS 470: Languages and Cultures of the Ancient Near East,"This course is an overview of the languages and cultures that populated the Ancient Near East.   Languages and Cultures of the Ancient Near East (3) (IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.This course aims to provide students with a wide overview of the languages spoken in the Ancient Near East. The goal is to go beyond the merely linguistic sketches of the main grammatical features of these languages. In fact, the focus will be placed on historical, literary, social, anthropological, and ethnic matters: language contact settings; relations between language and ethnicity; sociolinguistic aspects of language evolution, language variation, bilingualism, and diglossia; relations between historical and social patterns and the literary, bureaucratic, and popular uses of language; etc. In order to address this ample variety of issues, the students will be introduced first to the essential set of facts needed to comprehend the sociolinguistic history of each region, i.e., basic overviews of the languages in question, their linguistic affiliation, the main periods of their history as evolving linguistic realities, and their different writing systems. These overviews will immediately open the door to the discussion of a tapestry of topics concerning the realities behind these languages, especially their speakers and their ethnic, historical, and political identity. This inquiry into the facets of language as an inherently human reality will lead to a miscellaneous constellation of problems, such as, for instance, the construction of a national identity through the use, revival, or vindication of a concrete language or dialect. Students will be required to do a number of readings before each class. These readings will include basic historical sketches of the languages and linguistic traditions with which the course will deal. Moreover, students will be expected to give a presentation based on some of the optional readings listed on the syllabus. Thus, every class will consist of a lecture on the topic and a critical and open discussion of the assigned readings. Every lecture will take into account the assigned readings and will be accompanied by some handouts. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation (including a class presentation), as well as on writing assignments. The writing assignments will include take-home examinations. This course complements other existing courses in areas such as Ancient Near Eastern studies, biblical studies, Classics, Ancient History, and Linguistics. Moreover, this is one of the several history and culture courses in CAMS that provide overviews of major civilizations of the Mediterranean and Near Eastern regions."
CAMS 494: Research Project,Supervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.
CAMS 50: Words: Classical Sources of English Vocabulary,"Words: Classical Sources of English Vocabulary (3) (GH)(BA) offers an introduction to the history, structure, and meaning of modern English words that are formed from Latin and Greek elements. Many English language users are unacquainted with Latin and Greek or unaware that these languages are the etymological sources for at least 60 percent of English vocabulary. Consequently, it is common for students to have difficulty understanding or implementing English words derived from Latin and Greek.  leads students through a program that helps them to learn and analyze the form and meaning of the Latin and Greek roots and affixes that occur most frequently in English vocabulary. Class lectures, textbook readings, workbook exercises, and various kinds of classwork show students how to research and explain the etymologies of English words and in particular how to use dictionaries and the explanatory methods of comparative historical linguistics. By understanding the relationship of English to other languages in the Indo-European family tree and by taking account of the historical events and social circumstances that gave rise to the borrowing of words from other languages, students will also come to understand when, how, and why modern English vocabulary has become so indebted to Latin and Greek. A secondary aim of the course is to explore specialized vocabularies in the humanities, medicine, law, science, and technology, whose word-stock is predominantly of Latin and Greek origin. Upon completion of the course, students will have increased their vocabulary and be able to recognize and analyze new words derived from Greek and Latin sources."
CAMS 5Z: Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations,"Survey of the history and cultures of ancient Mediterranean civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syro-Levant, Anatolia, Greece, and Rome.  Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations (3) (GH;IL), linked to . This course provides an introduction to the history and cultural traditions of the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. From the origins of cities and the invention of writing, it surveys the intellectual, artistic, and political traditions that laid the foundations for the later civilizations of Europe and western Asia. Students will acquire a basic historical framework for the ancient Mediterranean from the third millennium BCE through the end of antiquity in the first millennium CE. Within this framework cross-cultural relationships of time and ideas will be established among religious texts, epic literatures, political and legal traditions, and their representations in art and architecture.

CAS 100A: Effective Speech,"This general education course explores how people use techniques of oral communication to address practical, professional and civic problems. It is designed to introduce students to principles of effective public speaking, implemented through the design and presentation of individual speeches. Class size is limited to ensure that scheduled meetings can support students in focusing on the development of public speaking skills through in-class activities, collaborative learning, peer critiques, and examinations of various communication practices.  Drawing upon concepts from the study of both rhetoric and communication science, the course aims to foster habits of ethical self-reflection alongside practical speaking skills. To that end, course content centers on the diverse ways that students participate in practices of citizenship and civic engagement. Linking content to practice, students are expected to demonstrate course concepts through the situational, generic, and ethical choices they make in composing their major speech assignments.  At least three individual graded speeches are required in this course. Additional presentations (graded or non-graded) may be required by some instructors. Following major speeches, students may compose reflective essays engaging in the critique and assessment of their own and others' work. Assessment may include evaluation by a combination of exams (although no final exam is given in the course) and/or occasional quizzes and other activities, all of which emphasize the mastery and application of the conceptual content of the course. Presentations are evaluated for content, organization, and presentation.  Numerous sections of  are offered throughout the university system in any given semester.

"CAS 251: Communication, Advocacy, and Entrepreneurship","Communication, Advocacy, and Entrepreneurship empowers students to utilize the process of entrepreneurship as a form of advocacy to enhance the human condition and improve public life. Students in this course learn the ""Lean Startup"" methodology of entrepreneurship through the simulated team-based activity of launching a startup to address an important societal exigence. Student startup teams will interrogate the rhetorical constructs that enable and constrain advocacy-based solutions to exigencies such as economic inequality, mental health, racism and sexism, and political disenfranchisement, and utilize qualitative research methods to develop key social venture hypotheses around their own simulated startups that will be tested through a minimum of 30 ¿client discovery¿ interviews and secondary research. This course offers a critique of the business paradigm of ¿maximize shareholder value,¿ which privileges rapid scalability and growth, maximized profit, and ROI (Return on Investment), and invites students to consider the impact this dominant view of business has on companies¿ commitment to environmental performance, social responsibility, employee well-being, and organizational mission. Students are encouraged to adopt the ethical business framework of nonprofits and emerging alternatives such as B Corporations and social enterprises, which provide assessments to help companies raise their standards for legal transparency, environmental responsibility, and worker and community well-being. Student simulated startups are designed to give voice to those disenfranchised by systems and discourses of power, and student teams are encouraged to see their solutions as offering services and/or interpretive frameworks that remedy inequity and promote healing, justice, and empowerment within the constraints of a specific moment in time. For example, students concerned about the impact of substance abuse on mental well-being and academic success could create a startup to help colleges/universities alter their messaging about alcohol use and/or implement sober living option best practices, or a student victimized by developmental sexual trauma could draw upon the latest research on healing and the body to propose a startup to raise awareness about natural treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. Students who complete Communication, Advocacy, and Entrepreneurship are encouraged to consider advancing their idea from simulated startup to real startup by participating in the vast array of educational and fundraising opportunities within Penn State¿s entrepreneurship ecosystem (e.g., Happy Valley Launchbox, Invent Penn State, Startup Week, Global Entrepreneurship Week)."

CHE 444: Chemical Game Theory,"""Chemical Game Theory"" (CGT), uses well-known, rigorous principles from Chemistry and Chemical Engineering to solve strategic decision problems that could be analyzed using Traditional Game Theory (TGT). In strategic decisions, players each can choose from among two or more alternative possibilities, and the outcome depends upon the collective choices from all players. In this course we will analyze some of the premises of TGT as compared with CGT. In CGT, the players' choices are treated as metaphorical molecules, and outcomes are calculated according to chemical reaction methods. The important concept of entropic choices is introduced, and pre-bias effects are included naturally as initial concentrations of reactants. CGT is not a generalization of TGT; rather, it represents contested decision problems differently, and gives different solutions. In this article we use the formalism of Chemistry to provide a ""knowlecular approach"" to analyzing contested decisions. This approach has a rich capacity to represent decision-making scenarios and serve as a decision-making algorithm for contested decisions, where leadership power plays an important role."

The Arthurian legend is an ideal vehicle for showing the ways in which literary works capture and express changing value systems in different cultural and historical situations, and thus the course is a good example of comparative (international) approaches to literary study. Classes will discuss the changing cultural' ideals represented, the different characterizations of the central figures, and the literary, techniques employed. Lectures and discussions will be supplemented by overheads, slides, music, and films or film clips dealing with Arthurian themes. Throughout, the course will ask why and how the stories of Arthur and the Round Table fellowship have captured the imagination of artists, political and religious leaders, and readers throughout the ages and around the world. Finally, it will ask how the practical concerns of daily life are developed in this literature-for example, how does this highly imaginative literature address practical concerns such as striking a balance between one's short-term goals and personal gratifications, and one's long-range obligations to other people? Means of evaluation will be selected from the following (always including writing): essay exam questions, short answer and objective questions, reading journals, quizzes, in-class discussion, group projects (including web sites), research and critical papers, and final comprehensive written exam.  is not required for the Comparative Literature major but may be selected to fulfill one of the course requirements for the major or the World Literature Minor.

"CMLIT 107: Exploration, Travel, Migration, and Exile","The Literature of Exploration, Travel, Migration, and Exile (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.   compares the literatures of travel, migration, exploration, and exile from ancient times to the future, from narratives of journeys actually experienced through narratives of journeys imagined in the mind. The notion of the journey is broadly defined as encompassing both literal and metaphorical experiences, including travel journals and diaries, epic adventures, quests of introspection, dreams and visions, and depictions of the future. Through reading, discussion, and writing, you will examine and compare the different roles that travel can play in the imaginations of both the individual writers and the cultures from which they come. You will not only explore recurrent themes and timeless topics, but also the ways in which travel writing can both reinforce and subvert the basic value-systems, stereotypes, or other assumptions present in its cultural context. For many writers, traveling elsewhere is a means of evaluating their own societies, as well as a means of recording their responses to encountering real or imagined new places. The journeys of this course, which vary greatly from each other, will also allow you to consider some of the vast unknowns of the individual human mind and imagination. By traveling through this course, you will have the opportunity to develop the analytic reading, thinking, and writing skills necessary for the understanding of a variety of literatures and cultures, as well as the exploration of your own identity as an individual. This course fulfills requirements for the Comparative Literature major, the World Literature minor, General Education Humanities, Bachelor of Arts Humanities, and General Education International/Intercultural Competency."

COMM 208N: Visual Representations of the Middle East in the US and Middle East,"This course is an introduction to the visual culture, the visual experience and sociological/historical context of images of the Middle East in the US mass media. The focus of the course will be on reading and interpreting visual images (painting, photography, film, illustration, digital media) and analyzing the larger social and cultural forces that shape the production, distribution and consumption of these media forms. We will explore these issues by focusing on a series of images/case studies located in a specific historical context, allowing us to introduce some of the major movements in visual culture, explore the social contexts of these images, and the ways in which the visual experience shapes our social lives and personal identities. Course evaluations will include exams, writing assignments, a class blog, and a final art project. The course examines visual representations of cultures over time, providing students with the artistic, historical, political and sociological context of their production. This integrative framework will enable students to understand how the creation of visual media and its interpretations both influence and are influenced by social context. It will introduce students to integrative thinking by providing them with interpretive techniques of the social sciences and the arts to increase their powers of visual analysis so that they can discuss an image's medium, composition, style and iconography. The course will examine the ways that the arts can be an expression of cultural values, helping students to comprehend the hegemonic aspects of image composition, production, exhibition and distribution. The course will explore the social milieus in which media is created, often depicting stereotypical images that poorly represent the complexity of the myriad cultural groups in the Middle East."
COMM 222N: Social Justice and the Image,"How do we perceive injustice? What are the roles of images in our perceptions of justice? If justice lies in the eyes of the observer, as the saying goes, what are the eyes seeing? Creating an image does not only mean creating the strictly visual, but also words that capture the imagination. Where do those words lead us? Social Justice and the Image (GA/GH) prompts students to reflect upon image-making and the reception of images in a variety of social justice contexts, to study the public claims made upon these images, and to explore interdisciplinary texts on social justice that assist us in interpreting those claims. Students will be introduced to a variety of critical approaches to social justice, and reflect upon how these images are connected to social movements, visual rhetoric, poetic protest, and rights-building. Readings will generally be determined by the instructor, and may include the work of authors such as Confucius, Plato, Aristotle, Asho Zarathushtra, Mary Wollenstonecraft, Louis Althusser, Gordon Avery, Gloria Anzaldúa, John Rawls, Roland Barthes, Warren J. Blumenfeld, Judith Butler, Virginia Held, Patricia Hill Collins, Donna Haraway, bell hooks, and Seyla Benhabib, and Ximena Zúñiga. The subjects of study will be images, justice, and the categories ascribed to them, but also the possibility of challenging those categories. Rather than focus on how justice and images are treated by various disciplines separately, students will be asked to explain how various disciplines speak to (or perhaps ignore) one another, and what is missing from the analyses. ""Interdisciplinary work,"" Roland Barthes wrote, ""is not about confronting already constituted disciplines (none of which, in fact, is willing to let itself go) . . . Interdisciplinarity consists in creating a new object that belongs to no one.""

Sometimes guilty parties go free and sometimes innocent people are convicted. In this course, we will employ the perspective of the social scientist to understand why and how wrongful convictions occur. How can social science help to predict, explain, and prevent wrongful convictions? This course is organized into three units. In the first unit, we will examine the large body of social science research that demonstrates disparities in all stages of the criminal justice system. For example, young Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. This is partly due to these men disproportionately living in environments that foster crime, but social science research shows sometimes it's also partly due to the discretionary decisions of police, prosecutors, and courts. As a result, these demographic groups are most likely to be wrongfully convicted. In the second unit, we'll explore the factors in the justice system that might lead to a wrongful conviction, including false confessions, eyewitness misidentification, poor legal representation, government misconduct, and informants and snitches. Social scientific findings elucidate how each of these factors influence conviction accuracy. Finally, we'll discuss how social science research on the risks and factors that contribute to wrongful convictions can be used to improve policies to reduce the risk of such convictions. Simple reforms such as openness about plea-bargaining, eyewitness identification reform (e.g., sequential lineups, double-blind procedures, etc.), recording of interrogations, and introducing Innocence Commissions in every state can improve our criminal justice system."

The learning objectives of the course are that the students are able to choose appropriate programming models for a big data application, understand the tradeoff of such choice, and be able to leverage state-of-the art cyber infrastructures to develop scalable data analytics or discovery tasks. Building on data models covered in , this course will introduce programming models such as MapReduce, data flow supports for modern cluster computing environment, and programming models for large-scale clustering (either a large number of data samples or a large number of dimensions). Using these frameworks and languages, the students will learn to implement data aggregation algorithms, iterative algorithms, and algorithms for generating statistical information from massive and/or high-dimensional data. The realization of these algorithms will enable the students to develop data analytic models for massive datasets."
DS 440W: Data Science Capstone,"The Data Sciences capstone develops the research orientation and creative problem solving necessary for successful careers. The capstone develops these skills in the context of a semester long project, the solution to which requires integration of knowledge, skills and analytic techniques taught in the core curriculum. The Data Sciences capstone will also give student a real world experience in which they will need to work in teams and will be coached on ways to translate analytic outcomes into meaningful and actionable information for decision makers. The course is intended for seniors who have successfully completed the core courses. The capstone projects will integrate knowledge gained in technical subjects such as machine learning, data mining, data integration and visualization. The project will also require students to analyze the privacy and security aspects of the problem as well as apply concepts of decision analysis. Students will also hone their presentation and technical writing skills, generating effective reports that not only explain their analytic processes, assumptions underlying the processes and outcomes, but also communicate the limitations of their approach and potential alternate strategies."
EARTH 103N: Earth in the Future:  Predicting Climate Change and Its Impacts Over the   Next Century,"Earth has a complex, fascinating, interconnected system of processes that control the state of the climate. If we can understand how this system works, then we can make intelligent predictions about the climate in the future. The future of climate is of great importance to the quality of life in the future. In this class, we will explore the workings of the climate system ¿ at the present, and in the past ¿ through a series of modules with hands-on learning activities. We will learn how simple and sophisticated computer models can provide useful tools for making predictions about what our climate will be like in the next few hundred years, which will be a critical time for our species as we endeavor to find a more sustainable way of living. A changing climate means changes in, among other things, temperature and precipitation, which will affect our water supplies, our energy consumption, and our ability to grow enough food to feed the people of Earth. A changing climate also means a range of stresses on the global economy. We will examine these climate impacts, but we will not stop there ¿ we will also focus our attention on what can be done to help us successfully meet these challenges"
EARTH 155N: Scientific Controversies and Public Debate,"Scientific Controversies and Public Debate is an introduction to critical thinking about the messages consumers get from public relations (PR) on behalf of industry, and from scientists regarding environmental health risks. Because such messages may be contradictory, the course seeks to help students understand the extent to which message communication influences our perception of risk. The course is designed to familiarize students with science topics that, because of message manipulation, are (or historically were) perceived as controversial (e.g., smoking, secondhand smoke, flame retardants, nuclear energy, the ozone hole, global climate change, acid rain, junk science, rBGH milk, biosolids, pesticides, vaccines, and endocrine disrupting chemicals). Students will learn the science and environmental health risks underlying several controversial topics. They will be guided to consider how industry and science messaging has shaped their own perceptions of risk. Then, using tools for effective communication, and avoiding communication pitfalls and deceptive tactics, students will combine accurate science content with compelling storytelling in a professional-quality video to inform the public about a targeted environmental health risk and persuade the public to avoid that risk.  focuses on the intersection between science and communication in the realm of environmental health. The course guides students to closely examine controversial environmental health topics, learn the science to understand public health risks, learn strategies to identify false or misleading arguments, and then think critically about industry and science messaging, including the impact of such messaging on their own lives.  Scientific Controversies and Public Debate is an interdomain course that integrate GN environmental health topics with GH message evaluation. It has no prerequisites, and is designed for students who may be unfamiliar with, or have only introductory knowledge of controversial environmental health topics, the norms of science communication, and public relations techniques."
EARTH 200N: Earth Systems Through a Soc & Envir Justice Lens,"Earth Systems through a Social and Environmental Justice Lens is an introduction to critical thinking about the intersectionality between environmental degradation and human harm. The course seeks to help students understand the relationships among lack of access (e.g., to credit, affordable housing, good schools, greenspace, healthcare, nutritious food, walkable streets), social factors (e.g, racism, poverty, unemployment), and environmental hazards (e.g., pollution, natural disasters, disease, heat islands, rising sea level, melting permafrost) for marginalized groups, and the institutional structures that support inequality. The course is designed to familiarize students with commonly misunderstood SJ topics such as race as a social (not biological) construct, historical racial inequality, and its present-day consequences (e.g., wealth and education gaps), environmental racism, the root causes of urban poverty, redlining, etc.  Case studies will familiarize students with major environmental issues in each sphere (anthroposphere, biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and atmosphere). In addition to academic content, research suggests that case studies help students make meaningful affective connections and practice empathy. The case studies presented in  show EJ issues from the perspective of marginalized groups that have organized to reduce inequalities.  Students will learn the science underlying major environmental issues associated with exceeding Earth's planetary boundaries in areas such as biogeochemical cycling, climate change, chemical pollution, and freshwater use. The scale (local, regional, global) of various environmental issues will be discussed.   Earth Systems through a Social and Environmental Justice Lens is an interdomain course that integrates GN Earth systems science with GS social justice (SJ) and environmental justice (EJ). It has no prerequisites, and is designed for students who may not be familiar with the intersectionality between environmental degradation and human harm."
EARTH 2: The Earth System and Global Change,"is a broad introduction to the Earth and to the forces and processes that shape the present-day global environment. The course focuses on global-scale changes, both natural and human-induced. These include: global climate change, destruction of stratospheric ozone, tropical deforestation, species extinction, and the loss of biodiversity. The discussion of these modern environmental issues occupies about 40% of the course. Unlike other ""environmental"" courses, this one sets these issues in the context of the long-term evolution and natural variability of the Earth systems. Thus, the course is structured around three major themes--the issues of global change, time scales of change, and understanding the Earth as a system. By the end of this course, we expect students to: 1) Recognize that: - the Earth operates as a complex system, - there is considerable interaction between the different components of this system (e.g. atmosphere, oceans, solid Earth, and biota), - changes in one part of the system can be expected to impact all others to a greater or lesser degree. 2) Develop an understanding of how the Earth system operates at the global scale, and the consequences this has for regional variability. 3) Understand how this system has evolved through time. 4) Understand how to use systems and graphical analyses to predict system response to perturbations. As a result of this course, we expect students to: 1) Synthesize this information to better appreciate the complexity of modern global change issues. 2) Be in a position to make more informed judgments on the nature and seriousness of these issues."
"EBF 304W: Global Management for the Earth, Energy, and Materials Industries","The real world is often complex and unstructured. A major goal of this course is to teach you how to structure ""real-world"" environmental and energy problems that involve business decisions in the face of uncertainty. The focus of this course is problems in environmental and resource management, but rather than teaching you specific facts, the goal of this course is to teach you how to think systematically about problems at the interface between business, society, and the environment. The course develops a number of tools for analyzing decision problems where impacts on the environment or human health and safety are important components. These tools include benefit-cost analysis, technological and environmental risk assessment, decision-making under uncertainty (perfect and imperfect information), and Monte Carlo analysis. Students will then use these models in the homework assignments and projects to solve a number of different decision problems."
EBF 483: Introduction to Electricity Markets,"This course is designed to teach students about the structure of the electricity industry, the regulatory institutions that oversee the industry, and the new market institutions that have been put into place since electricity restructuring. Much of the focus will be on the U.S. electricity industry. Since Pennsylvania has been a national leader in electricity restructuring, we will place particular emphasis on events in the Mid-Atlantic region, but will also discuss other market structures in the U.S. and in other countries. Specific topics covered will include cost models for power generation, transmission and distribution; rate of return regulation for electric utilities; the process of electricity restructuring and creation of electricity markets; Locational Marginal Pricing of electric energy; financial risk management in electric power; and detecting and mitigating market power."

ECON 323: Public Finance,", Public Finance (3) (GS) (BA). This course examines contemporary fiscal institutions in the United States, public expenditures, public revenues, and the incidence of major taxes such as the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, and consumption taxes. We also discuss intergovernmental fiscal relations in a federal system of government, and public debt (or deficit financing). We explore the economic rationale for, the current data, and status of the political debate on these topics and others as time permits. Some of the key topics discussed in the lectures include externalities and solutions to market failure associated with them, efficient provision of public goods, and cost-benefit analysis as a nonmarket way to allocate scarce resources. We also devote a substantial amount of time to the market for health care and the role of government in the provision of health care in the United States. In addition to government¿s role in health care, we spend a great deal of time on other major federal government spending programs including social security and a number of spending programs targeted at low income citizens. The later includes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Here, students are expected to critically analyze the major effects of these programs on poverty as well as incentives to work. On the revenue side of public finances, we focus on both the redistributive and efficiency effects of taxation. We discuss the statutory and economic incidence of consumption taxes, the personal income tax, and the corporate income tax. The last part of the course includes two major topics deficit financing and intergovernmental fiscal relations. In the deficit-financing chapter, we focus on the federal government debt. Students learn about the different measures of public debt, which include gross national debt, intergovernmental debt, and debt held by the public. Under intergovernmental fiscal relations, we discuss the delineation of spending responsibilities between the federal and state governments. We also discuss major funding sources for states and local governments in the United States."
ECON 333: International Economics,", International Economics (3 credits) (GS) (BA). This course applies the knowledge from Introductory of Microeconomics () and Introductory of Macroeconomics () into International trade. Students will learn about why nations trade and the effects of trade on both consumer and producer. Some people will gain and some people will lose from trade and students will learn how to measure gain and loss from trade. This class also introduces trade barrier policies imposed by the government such as tariff, quota, subsidy and other commercial policy such as dumping and countervailing duty. The creation of the international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are discussed. Later in the course, the Macroeconomics side of the international trade is discussed as well as the Balance of Payments, which is a way to summarize and measure a countries trade with the rest of the world. Students will also examine some of the basics of the foreign exchange market and the relationship with the interest rates. Toward the end of the course, the lessons will cover the International monetary systems, which include the gold standard, Bretton Woods system, fixed exchange rates, and flexible exchange rates"
ECON 351: Money and Banking,"Money, credit, commercial and central banking, financial intermediaries, treasury operations, monetary policy. Students who have already taken  may not schedule this course.   Money and Banking (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. In this course, students learn all about the Federal Reserve and the conduct of monetary policy: both conventional and unconventional. Students will examine many different interest rates and learn how they are determined. Students will study the importance of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and become familiar with business cycles in the US economy since 1970 and the associated Fed policy during these episodes. Term structures of interest rates are analyzed as well as the risk structure of interest rates. The Taylor Rule and various specifications of the Taylor Rule are applied to these topics. Students also study the efficient market theory and the determination of stock and bond prices. The course finishes by engaging students in the topics of futures, options, and futures options and hedging with futures and options.The objective of the course is help students get a better understanding of macroeconomic and monetary topics and policy. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to contribute to any discussion about the U.S. economy and Federal Reserve policy, analyze real world events as they relate to U.S. monetary policy, and share their newly acquired human capital with others.The prerequisite for this course is ECON104. Students who have taken ECON451 cannot schedule ECON351."
ECON 397: Special Topics,"Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in-depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."
ECON 408W: Intellectual Property,"A comparative and cost-benefit analysis of intellectual property that examines patents, copyrights, government supported research, and prizes.   Intellectual Property (3)We live in a society that has a decentralized system based on the institutions of private property and trade. In such a system, things belong to people and can be transferred by their owners to other people. An exchange that moves something to someone who values it more than its present owner produces a net benefit, which may be shared between the parties to the exchange. Thus such a system tends to move everything to those who most value it, producing an efficient allocation of goods and services. The logic and limitations of this process make up the branch of economics called price theory. The course undertakes an examination of intellectual property, a subfield of property rights. In the context of intellectual property, there are five specific areas of note: patent races, poorly constructed incentives, standards, licenses, and an examination of costs. There are three factors relevant to the costs of providing legal protection to some particular sort of intellectual property. One is how easy it is to define and defend property in that sort of idea. Another is the degree in which someone who creates and claims ownership in that particular sort of intellectual property reduces, by so doing, the options available to other people. The more serious these problems are, the less the gains from defining and enforcing property rights in ideas. Where they are sufficiently serious, we are better off with an intellectual commons--a legal regime in which certain classes of ideas are free for all to use than with intellectual property. These three costs must be balanced against the benefits--production of more and better intellectual property and better coordination of intellectual property once produced. The larger these benefits are likely to be, the greater the costs we are willing to bear in order to get them. The course objectives are to apply the framework of comparative and cost-benefit analysis to the study of intellectual property. The course will examine the empirical evidence, and also consider policy issues in this area."
ECON 411W: Behavioral Economics,"Topics in behavioral economics; selected games; evolutionary models of social behavior; culture and social behavior; herding; overconfidence.   Behavioral Economics (3)Behavioral economics examines recent evidence from experiments that seems to violate the hypotheses of economic rationality in traditional microeconomic theory. The course considers, among others, the following three topics: (1) Altruism in human behavior, as demonstrated, for example, in public goods experiments where people typically contribute some positive amount, even with the individually optimal strategy being to contribute nothing. (2) The prevalence of co-operative behavior in societies, which seems essential to their functioning, but which is hard (but not impossible) to explain on the basis of the actions of purely self-interested individuals. (3) Fairness in distribution: for example, people do not try to extract everything that their partners or opponents can give even when they are in a position of power (as in being the proposer of a take-it-or-leave-it offer). Students play some well-known games with each other to generate examples of their own behavior in multi-person interaction contexts; the results of the games are analyzed to detect regularities in the observed behavior; and the class discusses possible explanations drawn from economics, evolutionary biology and psychology as to why people (specifically the students) played the way they did in these games. Overall, then, students will learn about various aspects of behavioral economics, including several games and evolutionary models of social behavior, and how these aspects square with conventional economic theory. Students will develop the skill of analyzing behavior from a behavioral economics perspective. This course is a 400-level seminar, part of the Economics Department's offerings, many of them writing-intensive, for our advanced students in each of seven broad areas of economics. This writing-intensive seminar is in the area of microeconomic theory. The course will count toward both the major and the minor in economics."
"ECON 412: Labor Economics and Labor Markets: Theory, Evidence, and Policy","Advanced topics in labor economics: theory, empirical evidence, and policy.   Labor Economics and Labor Markets: Theory, Evidence, and Policy(3)This course is an advanced course in labor economics. Its coverage of topics overlaps somewhat with the topics covered in , but typically the treatment of the topics considered will be distinctly more rigorous for this 400-level course. The broad areas that will be focused on in the course include labor supply, investment in human capital, labor demand, wage determination, search and unemployment, and earnings inequality. The objective of this course is to introduce students to topics in labor economics with a rigorous and advanced analytical approach. For each topic, the course will consider the underlying theory, pertinent empirical evidence, and implications for public policy. The instructional and educational objectives are to provide students with a strong background in labor economics. This will allow them to take advanced seminar courses in the labor field. This course is an advanced introduction to labor economics, and as such has a prerequisite of either  or . In turn, this course will serve as a gateway to advanced seminar courses in labor economics at the 400 level that the Economics Department is in the midst of creating. The course will count toward both the major and the minor in economics."
ECON 421: Analysis of Economic Data,"There are many data sets but the information contained within them for economic analysis is often unclear without substantial investigation. The broad course objectives are 1) to familiarize students with the deficiencies of real-world data and 2) teach students how to address those deficiencies. Specific topics addressed include the reliability of data sources, the ambiguity in variable definitions, the miscoding of variables, and missing data. In addition, truncation and censoring from the data collection methodologies are examined. The econometric methods of linear regressions and instrumental variables are used to analyze the results of a model with and without the data errors. The results are studied to predict how the missing data can alter model outcomes and policy choices. Several economic data sets are examined to illustrate the concepts. Specific examples of datasets include microeconomic data such as industry growth and profits, elasticity and revenue estimates from pricing choices, output of homogenous goods such as gold and oil, consumer subscription rates to services such as cell phone and internet service and discount memberships, and the efficacy of new drugs in tests. Macroeconomic data topics include discussions regarding unemployment and job data forecasts and how this can relate to future monetary and fiscal policy. Other topics discussed include sample bias and low response rates to surveys, in which the numerical values of dataset itself were not manipulated, but gathered from samples which will give an inaccurate result. These issues can affect polling and predictions in elections. This course is an applied course in the field of econometrics and will seek to provide students with the analytical methods for understanding the economic content of data. The instructional and educational objectives are to expose students to the practical details of analyzing economic data in the context of an advanced seminar. The course will count toward both the major and minor in economics."

ECON 455W: Economics of the Internet,"Economics of the Internet; electronic commerce and network economics; pricing issues; intellectual property.   Economics of the Internet (3)The Internet has become an important part of the economy in the United States and worldwide. Often we think of the information available on the Internet as a free good, much like the air we breathe. However, the Internet is an active marketplace with unique characteristics. Internet access providers sell keywords and advertising space by means of special auction and exchange mechanisms. Intellectual property is an important and evolving concept within the Internet, especially given its worldwide application. This course is an applied microeconomics course and will seek to provide students with the analytical methods of both the theoretical and empirical analysis of the economics of the Internet. The course will count toward both the major and minor in economics. This proposal is part of a broader curriculum overhaul to 400-level economics courses. The Economics Department seeks to provide students with a series of advanced seminar courses in each of seven broad fields in the discipline; this is a course in the field of applied microeconomics."

Students will learn how to use these approaches to interpret findings and draw conclusions from quantitative data."
EDPSY 11: Educational Implications of Individual Differences in Childhood,"is a course about individual differences in learners that may stem from biological and environmental influences on development and wellness. This course addresses the ways in which we consider these differences as we design environments for learners in early and middle childhood. Course content includes cognitive, language, social-emotional, moral and physical development of students in pre-elementary through middle school settings. Content also includes understanding and promotion of health and wellness in educational settings; as well as individual differences that stem from gender, ethnic, racial, and other forms of diversity in children and youth. Both primary and secondary sources serve as foundational readings for the course. Readings share research on how and why variations occur, how to measure and interpret them, and what implications such variations have on traditional and non-traditional educational environments with emphasis on developmentally appropriate and individually appropriate educational practice. Specific applications for teacher certification are included. Within each topic area, the course will pay special attention to theoretical and empirical work on how and why variations occur, how they are to be interpreted and measured, and the implications those variations have for social policy and ethical dilemmas with particular attention to educational settings. Traditional and alternative practices in schools will be examined to see which approaches best meet the needs of an increasingly diverse American society. While the course will focus on individual differences in education, it will not be exclusively oriented toward future teachers. The course will also help students understand how course content relates to parents (or future parents) understand the nature of development and individual differences of children and the students as they progress through the educational system."
EDPSY 421: Learning Processes in Relation to Educational Practices,This course covers the major theories used to explain learning across educational settings.

EDSGN 15: Transformations by Design: First-Year Seminar,"Examination of the social and environmental transformations that follow engineering design, and of the transformations of students by higher education.  EDSGN 015S Transformations by Design: First-Year Seminar (1) Engineering design is a diverse field of study with many emerging topics and applications. The goal of this first-year seminar course is to introduce first-year students to engineering design. In turn, design is set within the essential dynamic context of technology: the transformation of the environment and society. Hence, doing design well means creating a better world and a sustainable environment. Students examine the global networks of product life cycles from extraction to disposal that is triggered by engineering design and how it affects people's lives and the environment.Since much engineering design is integrated design that brings together the disciplines and people necessary to achieve a design solution to a given problem, this FYS provides students with a vivid glimpse of engineering careers. This is developed further by student presentations that focus on their life goals and how their expected career in a given field of engineering will help them to achieve their goals.This course will combine lectures, discussions, teamwork, projects, and hands-on activities, with an emphasis on active learning and an examination of the transformations of technology from transducers to product life cycles.In addition to introducing first-year students to design topics and careers in engineering, this seminar course will help incoming students develop success skills and become acclimated to University life. But higher education is also presented to the students as a transformative process that reshapes their social relationships and determines much of their future.The course will be offered once a year in the fall semester."
EDSGN 270: Summers by Design: An International Engineering Design Experience,"The School of Engineering Design, Technology, and Professional Programs (SEDTAPP) offers this Penn State faculty-led study abroad program. Students will practice design with international collaborators in international environments and conduct design for global markets. In addition, students will learn to function in cross-cultural engineering design teams, partnering with students from both the U.S. and other global institutions. Specific locations of study are varied, and have included San Sebastian, Spain, and Nantes, France. This study abroad program takes place at a partnering university over a two-week period at the end of May. While enrolled in the course, participants will also experience many cultural activities relevant to the part of the world in which they find themselves, including partaking in local cuisine, visiting historical landmarks, and interacting with local engineering companies. This is an ideal program for Penn State engineering students as it allows students the opportunity to participate in a study abroad program while still having time to return home to complete a summer engineering internship. The objectives of the course include identifying global engineering design problems, developing effective engineering solutions within a cultural context, evaluating engineering designs with global parameters, working with a team consisting of designers from different global backgrounds, and effectively communicating engineering designs to a cross-cultural audience. Students will be evaluated through completion of pre-departure activities, participating in a design project while abroad, and completing a final project report upon their return. The course will be offered once a year through SEDTAPP and Penn State Global Programs."
EDSGN 294: Research Project,Supervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.
EDSGN 402: Materials and Manufacturing,"Students will study principles and properties of engineering materials and manufacturing processes with a focus on their appropriate selection in design. Based on these principles and properties, as well as hands-on laboratory experiences, students will develop systematic methods for matching material and process choices to the mechanical, thermal, electro-magnetic, and environmental constraints set by the technical requirements of a design problem or project. Knowledge of current manufacturing processes is required to align appropriate processes and materials with the requirements of designed products. Students will develop basic, practical knowledge and skills in operating manual and CNC machine tools. Both subtractive and additive manufacturing processes will be explored, and students will learn best practices for making informed choices between them based on design needs. Computer aided manufacturing will be introduced to provide background for future courses (e.g., senior capstone projects)."

EDTHP 115S: Competing Rights: Issues in American Education,"An examination of educational issues relevant to democratic citizenship; emphasis is on understanding the relationship among politics, schools, and society.   Competing Rights: Issues in American Education (3) (GS;US)(BA) FYS This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course offers students a chance to practice solving skills necessary for active and responsible citizenship. Because the course requires students to engage in detailed analysis of contested issues, students will: acquire information about the history and governance of public schools; develop an understanding of ideologies underlying existing schools and proposed reforms; and, as a result, be better equipped to make informed choices as voters. Major topics include curriculum design; school accountability; education of minority populations; the conflict between students' rights and the need of a school to maintain order; and the teaching of values. The course will require extensive reading, discussion (in-class and/or on-line), writing, and field research, to include such activities as interviewing teachers and politicians, or attending a school board meeting. Readings may include editorials, proposed legislation, court decisions, chapters from texts, essays and scholarly articles, and material from web sites of interested organizations (such as the National Education Association, the Christian Coalition, or the American Civil Liberties Union). After readings, analysis and discussion, students will prepare and defend a position on each issue, either individually or in groups, formally or informally, in speech or in writing. Students will be graded on their ability to support a particular stance with credible evidence, and on their ability to articulate the ideology underpinning a stance. Therefore, the ability to identify credibility of sources is inherent to success in the course. In general, this course draws upon concepts and information from history, political science, economics and philosophy as well as from education. As a General Education course, it seeks to help students broaden their perspective on social issues; to offer them practice in informed decision-making; and to understand and accept the responsibilities of active citizenship. The course might be particularly useful to social science majors because it will reveal interdisciplinary connections, while it will also be useful to the wider student body as a form of civic education."

The objective of this course is to introduce the student to digital design using Field Programmable ICs, and to provide an understanding of the underlying technologies and architectures of these Integrated Circuits.The course begins by introducing design alternatives for modern electronic systems identifying and classifying alternative system solutions, and evaluating when particular design solutions are optimal. These alternatives include microprocessors, microcontrollers, off-the-shelf digital ICs, Programmable logic ICs (FPGAs and CPLDs), and various forms of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designs. A homework assignment requires the student to quantitatively evaluate the cost, complexity, packaging, and time-to-market issues for a complex system design specification.Next, the underlying Field Programmable Logic IC architectures and technologies are studied in detail. Following a broad survey of available programmable IC vendors and on-chip programming technologies (and their cost/performance trade-offs), several specific case studies are presented in the class. The first is the Xilinx XC4000xl line, because of the target boards used in the CAD laboratory component for this class.

EE 454: Fundamentals of Computer Vision,"Introduction to topics such as image formation, segmentation, feature extraction, matching, shape recovery, object recognition, and dynamic scene analysis.  CMPEN 454CMPEN 454 Fundamentals of Computer Vision (3) is an introduction to computer vision. The goal of computer vision is to make computers understand and interpret visual information. Computer vision systems bring together imaging devices, computers, and sophisticated algorithms for solving problems in areas such as industrial inspection, medicine, document analysis, autonomous navigation, and remote sensing. The course involves both pedagogical written assignments and computer projects.The beginning of the course gives an overview of computer vision and introduces low level image analysis techniques for binary images. Binary vision systems are useful when the silhouette of imaged objects convey enough information to recognize them. Examples can be found in optical character recognition, chromosome analysis and recognition of industrial parts. Moreover, many techniques developed for binary systems can be applied to gray level or color images. Next, the course covers image segmentation and contours. These topics are the foundation of most computer vision techniques. For an image to be correctly interpreted, it must be partitioned into regions that correspond to distinct objects or parts of objects. First, region based techniques such as thresholding, split and merge, region growing and texture analysis are introduced. Next, edge based techniques using gradient and Laplacian operators are discussed. Finally, contour representations and curve approximations linking edges into region boundaries are studied.Next, depth from vision, with emphasis in stereo vision, is considered. Calculating distances to and among various points in the scene is important in many computer vision tasks such as inspection, robot manipulation, and autonomous navigation. In this part of the course the geometry of stereo systems and how to obtain depth maps from stereo image pairs is studied. Also, alternative 3D imaging sensors such as laser based range finders and radars are discussed.Following stereo, the topic of computer vision is broaden to understand sequences of images over time. In this section techniques using information on spatial and temporal changes are used to design computer vision systems capable of coping with moving and changing objects, changing illumination and changing viewpoints. Visual motion is important primarily for two reasons. First, motion is a very important cue to understand the scene structure. Second, biological systems do use motion to infer properties of the surrounding world with very little a priori knowledge.Finally, the topic of 3D object recognition is discussed. Object recognition entails two main issues: object identification and object localization. Identification determines the objects being imaged while localization determines their position in the world and with respect to the sensors. This topic builds upon all the different techniques discussed until this point."

The course explores the aesthetic of sequential narrative, its formal properties and generic range, its methods of production and consumption, and its place in a contemporary culture of reading."
ENGL 15S: Rhetoric and Composition,"English 15S is an intensive, rhetorically based experience in reading and writing that will prepare you both to understand the communications that surround you and to succeed in your own communication efforts. Thus, in this course, we will focus specifically on analyzing verbal and visual texts (our reading) as well as on producing such texts (our writing)-always in terms of rhetorical principles. Even if the term rhetoric isn't familiar to you, you bring  good deal of rhetorical skill to this class; you already know how to gauge the way you perceive and produce language according to the speaker, the intended audience, and the purpose. You may not always gauge perfectly, your perception may not always be accurate, and your production may not always be successful-but you still often try to interpret and choose language that is appropriate to the rhetorical situation. When you do not succeed, you often try again. The goal of English 15S, then, is to help you build on what you already know how to do as you become a more confident reader and writer. You will become more attuned to your goals as a writer, more aware of the ongoing conversation surrounding the topic, and more resourceful in terms of the appropriate delivery of your information, the rhetorical appeals at your disposal, and the needs and expectations of your audience. You will also learn to research and synthesize multiple outside sources in order to support your arguments effectively and ethically. In other words, we hope you'll come to write with skill, conviction, sophistication, and grace-if not immediately then soon. In the process, you'll learn how to read more critically as well."
ENGL 165N: Work and Literature,"If you get a job out of college, work eight hours a day, fifty weeks a year, and retire at age 65, at that point you have will spent roughly one third of your adult, waking life at work. And that is just paid work. Add in housework, childcare, and other forms of unpaid labor and the share of your waking hours devoted to work creeps closer to one half. And those calculations may actually underestimate the influence work has over your life. What you do will determine where you live, how you live, and, perhaps, whether you believe you have ultimately done something meaningful with your life. With work playing such an outsized role in a life, you may as well understand it as best you can. Hence this class. In it, we approach the question of work from the perspective of two disciplines: labor and employment relations and literature. The field of labor and employment relations asks about the social and economic forces-markets, compensation, globalization, immigration, etc.-that shape work. By contrast, the discipline of literature takes a more subjective approach to the question of work. Very broadly speaking, it shows how the forces that shape work play out in individual lives. In short, it shows how individuals feel about the work they do or, in the case of the unemployed, they do not do. Together, the two disciplines provide a global and personal perspective on one of the most important parts of our lives. Students registering for the course will read representative selections from both domains, engage in course discussions, take exams, and write essays as they explore the variety of ways both labor and employment relations and Literature can prepare them for their work lives and help them understand the place of work in culture and society."
ENGL 179: Exploring the Literature of Food: Current Trends in American Food Writing  and Environmentalism,"""Exploring the Literature of Food: Current Trends in American Food Writing and Environmentalism"" begins by demonstrating the deep history of environmentally-minded agriculture in American thought. In the sample course, an understanding of the relationship between environmentalism and farming is developed through a consideration of thinking about food and food production in texts from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. These texts might touch on the importance of notions about the political importance of yeoman farmers, thoughts on the blending of cultivation and wildness, and late-nineteenth-century critiques of cruel and unsanitary industrial food production. The class might then turn to texts that argue for a return to sustainable agriculture in terms of Jeffersonian democracy and the ideal of the citizen-farmer. The topics raised in the first portion of the course include environmentalism, the role of labor in America, and the history of the industrialization of farming in the post-World War II era. From these origins, the course progresses into a consideration of the contemporary moment. It is clear that a great deal of change has occurred since mid-twentieth century critiques, and students are encouraged to trace the development of topics from the first portion of the syllabus in the later material. For example, the development of organic food standards by the FDA has resulted in a new system of organic industrial agriculture, which is compared to small scale agriculture by Michael Pollan, and Eric Schlosser updates muckraking investigations of labor and sanitation by turning to modern investigative journalism into the production of meat and the standards of uniformity set by fast food chains. The course ends with a consideration of the future of food as writers have imagined it. With a recommended experiential component, students are learning about the history of food production and writing about it while they encounter farmers who practice sustainable agriculture. Ideally, students learn from both the literature and from the farmer how something as practical as the production of food can be informed by philosophy and literature."
ENGL 181C: The Beach: Exploring the Literature of the Atlantic Shore,"-""The Beach: Exploring the Literature of the Atlantic Shore""-begins with some exploration of the dynamic forces at work on the barrier beach, with special attention to the ways in which great literature has taken what is described in the scientific literature and turned it into art. Examples for discussion are drawn from the work of such writers as Rachael Carson and Henry Beston. The general concerns of the course then move to environmental ethics, specifically as ethical questions are embodied in literature's representation of the human relationship with the other-than-human world, from such difficult-to-personify species as starfish, snakes, and spiders. General ethical questions then lead to specific treatments of human and wild animal interaction by various writers. The point is to explore how writers represent the optimal sort of relationship humans can have with the wild world, and what such representation might mean to the ways we personally interact with nature. From these opening considerations, the course turns to an examination of the way in which writers who focus on a specific region of the coast--South Atlantic barrier islands, for example-- establish a sense of the place in their writing. The course then narrows its focus even more, moving from a consideration of a regional cultural identity to that of specific towns or narrowly defined areas within the general region. This narrowed subject is explored in specific detail, beginning with pre-European cultures, the first explorers and settlers and then moving on to other aspects of the American culture history that make the subject area distinctive. For example, a course on the Low Country of South Carolina might start with the accounts of John Lawson, who published his journal of his own trip up the Santee River in 1701, move to accounts of the rice culture so important to the region in the nineteenth century and to the an examination of the Gullah Geechee culture established by West African slaves on Low Country plantations, and then move to writing from more recent writers, all of which help to define the area¿s distinctive cultural and particularly its literary identity."
ENGL 182A: Literature and Empire,"Literature written in English from countries that were once part of the British Empire or some other European empire., e.g., India, Canada, South Africa, and others.  Literature and Empire (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. English 182A will constitute a wide ranging study of literature written in English, including novels, short stories, poems, plays, and prose, from countries that were once part of the British Empire or some other European empire. The class will approach this literature from a variety of thematic, historical, and/or generic vantages. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Chinua Achebe, Buchi Emecheta, Alan Paton, David Malouf, Robertson Davies, Ngugi Wa Thiongo, J. M. Coetzee, R. K. Narayan, Amitabha Ghosh, Salman Rushdie, Christina Stead, Thomas Keneally, Jill Ker Conway, V. S. Naipaul, Wilson Harris, and Michael Ondaatje. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but the course will often discuss matters of race and ethnicity, as well as matters of religion, gender, sexual orientation and global context, where appropriate. The principle emphasis of the works in this course will be the recognition of non-European/non-American societies and the differences between their culture and that of Europeans or Americans. The conflicts generated by clashing cultures will drive the choice of readings. By the end of the course, students will have studied works from a minimum of five different cultural perspectives. This class will also prepare students to consider social and cultural problems from a variety of cultural perspectives. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor."
"ENGL 183N: The Cold War in Literature, Politics, and History","The course will focus on the history and politics of the Cold War and its depiction in literature and film, especially in British and American literature, but also in that of other countries. Students will read political science and history texts, novels, short stories, and poetry, and view films. Students will analyze the reasons that the Cold War has been and continues to be a major inspiration for literary production and a transformative influence on literary style. Students will be encouraged to explore alternative methodologies for research on cold war topics including the use of primary sources, for ex. documents from the intelligence community archives that have since been declassified. In addition to a class field trip, students will be encouraged to make additional site visits to appropriate institutions in U.S. intelligence history. They'll be making a series of visits to relevant sites."
ENGL 184: The Short Story,"This course is designed to introduce students to the art of the short story and to acquaint them with some of its most talented writers. During the semester we will read short stories from various cultures and countries, ranging from stories written in the early nineteenth-century to those written within the last few years. Readings will include works from authors like Hawthorne, Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Bierce, Chekhov, Kafka, Chopin, Crane, Gilman, James, Cather, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Hemingway, Lawrence, Orwell, O'Connor, Baldwin, Olson, Silko, Erdrich, Ondaatje, Barth, Barthelme, Atwood, Mukherjee, Walker, Tan, Calvino, Garcia Marquez, and Cortazar. All readings will be in English. This course is intended to help one learn how to read fiction, how to understand it, and how to talk about it. The desire to tell stories and to be told stories is one of the most basic human needs, and all cultures have been defined in part by the stories they hear and the stories they tell. We are not born knowing how to read the short story or any fiction for that matter. Rather it is a skill that one acquires, and the more one does it, like playing tennis or any other activity, the better one becomes at it, for we learn what to look for. We will explore the historical development of the short story genre, and examine how historical contexts relate to the content and style of the stories under discussion. We will become familiar with how stories are put together and with the vocabulary that is used to discuss fiction--terms such as plot, narrative, character, tone, language, closure, irony, imagery. and so forth. CMLIT/ is not required for the CmLit major but may be selected to fulfill one of the course requirements for the major or the World Literature Minor. This course also fulfills the General Education Humanities requirement, the Bachelor of Arts Humanities requirement, and International Cultures requirement."
ENGL 191: Science Fiction,"As a genre of literature, science fiction enables human beings to model themselves as a cosmic species, a life form that imagines and inhabits an entirely new scale of being. No longer confined to a tribe, nation or tradition, science fiction narrates and explores the galactic magnitudes of both the external world of astronomical exploration (billions and billions of stars) and the inner world of subjective reality and imagination (billions and billions of neurons). This course introduces students to the surprisingly long history of science fiction as a way of exploring both the microcosm and the macrocosm, mapping a species imagining themselves into the future."
ENGL 208N: The Music of the Beatles and American Popular Culture,"The Beatles are the most significant musical group in the history of popular music. Their songs are derived from diverse sources, such as rhythm 'n' blues, rock 'n' roll, country 'n' western, Motown, soul, folk music, folk rock, the British Music Hall, and European and Indian classical music traditions. Two ideas define their work: an emphasis on freedom, and how song texts can be interpreted in different ways. The Beatles had a great impact not only on American popular music during their heyday in the 1960s but also on the country' s popular culture in which they were considered philosopher kings. Beatle albums mirrored changing trends in the culture, from the pre-Vietnam War youthfulness of A Hard Day's Night, to the psychedelia of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, to the countercultural mindset of The White Album. This inter-domain course will focus on how the Beatles influenced American popular culture from the 1960s to the present day. It will examine how the Beatles were a part of a mid-twentieth-century British youth subculture that was shaped by the cultural attitudes of American rock 'n' roll. The course will then turn its attention to the seismic shift initiated by the Fab Four in both music and pop culture in the US from 1964 to 1970, demonstrating how it has permeated the popular culture of the 1970s to the present day. The course will enhance the appreciation of the Beatles and their music through its interdisciplinary focus, contextualizing the Fab Four's work in order to show how both popular music and culture can influence one another. One way the course will facilitate this goal is through the inclusion of selected readings from English literature and popular culture upon which students will write reflection essays."
ENGL 214: Introduction to Creative Nonfiction Writing,"Introduces lyric and narrative forms in memoir writing and the personal essay.   Introduction to Creative Nonfiction Writing (3) Creative nonfiction borrows techniques from fiction and poetry while adhering to but also sometimes questioning notions of truth. It stretches the bounds of literary or narrative journalism by asking the reader to consider it as art, primarily, versus as testimony, fact, or information-delivery. Students taking this course will explore the genre's influences in fiction, research, and poetry; critical analyses will complement this exploration, and formal experimentation will prepare students to imagine novel relationships between form and content. Discussing traditional storytelling technique, the course introduces students to story rudiments including the inciting episode, rising and falling action, climax and denouement and the so-called swerve ending. The course also introduces students to the possibilities of the nonlinear ""lyric essay"" as outlined in Seneca Review and elsewhere, as well as to the ""modular"" essay; uses of blank space for communicating the unsayable; and how poetic style can circle elusive meaning.In exploring issues of nuance and implied or glanced-at meaning, the course also discusses the place of truth in nonfiction - differing constructions and conceptions of truth; reader expectations for factuality in a work of nonfiction; and the complications of unreliability when the fallibility of memory or a multiplicity of perspectives color testimony.Finally, the course examines the role of nontraditional structure in conveying a postmodern understanding of subjectivity, for instance by looking at the use of multiple voices and personae in the works of certain contemporary authors. While  teaches skills for the journalist in developing feature-style journalism and narrative personal essays, , alternatively, will explore and exploit the influence of fiction, poetry, and other lyric forms. Students in this course will produce writing more appropriate to a literary journal than a news magazine; their writing will concern broad, sometimes disjunctive themes, and stray away from the nut-graf, news-hook, or even an obvious narrative focus."
ENGL 215: Introduction to Article Writing,"Written exercises in, and a study of, the principles of article writing; practice in the writing of specific articles."
ENGL 221W: British Literature to 1798,"Focusing on major writers and their cultural contexts,  surveys British literature to 1798. A remarkable amount of important work was produced over this period. Students will read major texts like Beowulf, Romeo and Juliet, and Tom Jones; learn about renowned authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Fielding; and be introduced to influential literary forms, such as the epic, the revenge tragedy, and the picaresque novel. The tradition of British literature evolved over periods of significant upheaval and change. Students will also learn about the shifting historical and ethical orientations that energized this tradition, from the Heroic Ethos to Christian Humanism to Neoclassicism. As an introductory survey of British literature, English 221W welcomes non majors: no previous course in literature is required. By reading and discussing some of the best-known works in British literature, students will sharpen their skills of interpretation while surveying an important literary tradition."
ENGL 222: British Literature from 1798,"Focusing on major writers and their cultural contexts,  surveys British literature from 1798 to the present. A remarkable amount of important literature was produced during this period. Students will read major texts like Pride and Prejudice, Hard Times, and Jane Eyre; learn about renowned authors such as William Blake, Charles Dickens, and Virginia Woolf; and be introduced to influential literary forms, such as the dramatic monologue, the gothic novel, and stream-of-consciousness narrative. The tradition of British literature since 1798 evolved over periods of significant political and cultural upheaval and change. Thus students will also learn about the shifting historical and ethical orientations that energized this tradition, from rising industrialization and changing class and gender relations as manifested in Romanticism, Modernism, and Postmodernism. As an introductory survey of British literature,  welcomes non majors; no previous course in literature is required. By reading and discussing some of the best-known works in British literature, students will sharpen their skills of interpretation while surveying important literary traditions and gaining crucial critical insight into an international culture that literally influenced-through its imperial reach-countries around the world."
ENGL 232: American Literature from 1865,"Focusing on major writers and their cultural contexts, English 232 surveys American literature from 1865 to the present. A remarkable amount of important literature was produced during this period. Students will read major texts like The Great Gatsby, The Grapes of Wrath, and Beloved; learn about renowned authors such as Ernest Hemingway, Flannery O'Connor, and James Baldwin; and be introduced to influential literary forms, such as the imagist poem, the modernist novel, and New Journalism. The tradition of American literature since 1865 evolved over periods of significant upheaval and change. Students will also learn about the shifting historical and ethical orientations that energized this tradition, from Naturalism to Modernism and Postmodernism. As an introductory survey of American literature, English 232 welcomes non majors: no previous course in literature is required. By reading and discussing some of the most important works in American literature, students will sharpen their skills of interpretation while surveying an important literary tradition."
ENGL 245: Introduction to LGBTQ Studies,"An introduction to the dominant themes in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies, with an emphasis on both literary & cultural studies. This course explores the history of modern, western ideas about sexual identity as manifested in literature, theater, film, and other narrative forms of popular culture. Drawing on the substantial body of ""queer theory"" generated by scholars in the humanities since the 1990s, this class examines sexuality not as a ""natural"" or consistent phenomenon, but as a set of beliefs that have changed over time and manifest themselves differently in different cultural and historical contexts. Starting in the late nineteenth century, scientific and medical authorities began categorizing individuals into sexual types based on their manifestations of gendered characteristics and their erotic attractions and practices. This medical typing corresponded with the development of subcultures associated with deviance from sexual norms; these subcultures produced a rich variety of texts, images, performances, and social forms, many of which became central to both popular and high culture. This course explores this rich archive, moving among media. It investigates constructions of sexual conformity and how sexual nonconformists positioned themselves in relation to cultural and medical group identities. It examines how distinctions between gendered, raced, and classed bodies were historically produced and culturally contested. It considers what commonalities gay identities may - or may not -- share with lesbian identities and how transgender and other identities have altered perceptions of sexual identity. The course also explores the relationship of the avant-garde to the mass media and how sexual subcultures have shaped literary and other cultural forms of expression. Comparative study of issues of sexual mobility beyond and between the borders of the United States expands the course's critical scope beyond dominant forms of western culture. This course does not propose definitive answers to the questions of identity it addresses. Instead it negotiates the ways sexualities have enabled individuals to articulate -- and disarticulate -- themselves within social bodies past and present. This course, therefore, has wide relevance for students interested in how group identities come into being and transform over time in dynamic relation to other historical forces. Exploring a wide variety of cultural forms associated with the history of sexual identity as well as a variety of interpretations of that history, this course opens students to an archive of literature, theater, film, and other narrative arts with the potential to inform and enrich their understandings of many kinds of challenges to regimes of normativity today."
ENGL 250: Peer Tutoring in Writing,Introduction to theories and skills of successful peer tutoring in writing. Provides tutoring experience in a writing center.
ENGL 265: Reading Nonfiction,"Reading Nonfiction will provide students with a historical context and the reading skills necessary for this ""fourth genre"" of creative writing, with an emphasis on memoirs and the essays that have defined the genre across different eras. Biographies, autobiographies, travel narratives, science writing, and political writing could be included along with hybrid nonfiction such as graphic memoir and the video essay. As a reading (not writing) class, content will focus on the implicit contract of truth between the writer and the reader, with discussions to focus on the impact of a ""true story"" told creatively. What must the writer accomplish on the page in order for a reader to become engaged with this genre? The course will bring to the table questions of ethics and morals when applied to our latest understanding of the fallibility or reliability of memory and how authors use their memories to write nonfiction. Later weeks in the course will examine publishing trends in nonfiction and identify career paths for students wishing to further explore the scholarship of nonfiction."
ENGL 268: Reading Drama,"Reading Drama is a course that will cover elements of drama including plot, character, dialogue, staging, and dramatic forms in primarily British, American, and other English-language traditions. Students will explore different techniques for reading drama through a literary lense, including the overlap of reading for history, reading for theory, reading for pleasure, and reading as a preparation for the eventual staging of drama. Students can expect to encounter a range of drama presented in such a way that learning outcomes explore historical trends, artistic movements, critical reception, and drama's effect on culture, society, politics, and art. Students will by the end of the course have a solid foundation in comparing and contrasting styles of drama and will also be able to engage in the scholarly dialogue of analyzing dramatic literature to a depth that goes beyond appreciating the entertainment value of a good play."
ENGL 2: The Great Traditions in English Literature,"This course provides fundamental skills of textual analysis in the context of literary texts written in English, drama, and poetry (from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century) that address large questions of ethical and social value. Course reading includes English-language texts from around the world. Students learn to speak and write clearly about the ideas generated by the texts as they consider interpretive issues found in their assigned readings and participate actively in the various forms of critical thinking required to address those issues."
ENGL 312: Globality and Literature,"This course examines contemporary fiction that reflects on globality and globalization, most often from contexts where planetary crisis registers as linguistic or narrative disturbance: war, empire, economic underdevelopment, state repression, diaspora, immigration, or major historical shifts. Anglophone writings will be read alongside works in translation to track the common-or uncommon-conditions of humanity that results from economic and political globalization. The course pays special attention to questions of violence and justice, the principal preoccupations of human rights discourse."

ENGL 441: Chaucer,"This course surveys the literary career of Geoffrey Chaucer, perhaps the most celebrated English-language poet of the medieval ear. The course primarily examines Chaucer's own writings, with consideration of the several international authors and traditions that informed his own literary productions. Selections may vary, but students will read texts from across Chaucer's career, including from major works like Troilus and Criseyde and The Canterbury Tales. Readings from Chaucer's sources and models may include translated selections from Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy or from Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun's Romance of the Rose, and/or examples from relevant literary genres such as romance, fabliaux, beast fable, sermon, tragedy, and exemplum. Accordingly, students will develop a knowledge and appreciation of how Chaucer shaped (and was shaped by) his continental influences and the ways in which he developed a poetic tradition in English that proved deeply influential for many centuries."
ENGL 443: The English Renaissance,"Study of different early modern texts and traditions, with attention to poetry, drama, fiction, and nonfiction."
ENGL 444: Shakespeare,"Selected tragedies, comedies, and histories."
ENGL 447: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century,"Study of different English writers and traditions from the neoclassical age (1660-1776), with attention to poetry, fiction, romance, and drama."
ENGL 450: The Romantics,"Writers of the British Romantic period (roughly 1790 to 1832) often made sweeping claims for the power of poetry and imagination. Percy Bysshe Shelley contended that ""poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world,"" while John Keats declared that ""beauty is truth, truth beauty."" Against the background of political revolution in France, the rise of industrialization and empire, and increasing social instability, Romantic writers turned to nature as a source of the self and looked back to childhood as a site of both innocence and ambivalence. Others turned their efforts to the supernatural and the gothic, hoping to inspire what Samuel Taylor Coleridge called ""that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith."" This course is designed to provide an introduction to the richness and diversity of Romantic-era literature. It is not intended to be an exhaustive overview of the entire period, but rather an introduction to the best known Romantic ideas' many of which still influence the way we think about art and literature in the present day as well as an invitation to further study and engagement. In that spirit, we will not work from a predetermined definition of ""romanticism,"" but instead will build a collective, working understanding of the concept."
"ENGL 456: British Fiction, 1900-1945","Study of writers and traditions in British short fiction and novels, 1900-1945."
ENGL 460: Business and Literature,"An investigation into how writers and the cultures in which they write have represented business and those engaged in it. For many people, literature and business could not have less to do with each other. According to this view, literature escapes from reality to the imaginative, while nothing could be more focused on the real than business and its buying and selling of commodities and services. The problem is that no one told literary writers of this mutual incompatibility. For centuries, writers have peered into the world of business and brought back stories intended to document, inspire, and warn. True, writers have often, and sometimes unthinkingly, condemned business and those who follow it, but they have just as often had genuine insights into its workings. In this course, we will follow the relationship between literature and business over the course of modern history. Although one version of the course would begin with literature that dates back to the invention of capitalism in (more or less) the sixteenth century, our course will begin at the turn of the nineteenth century with the Industrial Revolution in England and the United States and follow the literature of business up to the present. Our aim in reading is not just to understand how writers have represented business and those who pursue it, which, it has to be admitted, has often been with contempt. But, rather, in reading more sympathetic works, to understand the drama of business, why those who pursue it find it so invigorating. Money, of course, is one answer to that question, but it is neither the only nor the most important one. Texts may vary, but they are almost certain to include Charles Dickens's Dombey and Son (1847); Herman Melville's ""Bartleby the Scrivener"" (1853); the ""Economy"" chapter of Henry David Thoreau's Walden (1854); Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now (1875); Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class (1899); George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara (1905); Theodore Dreiser's The Financier (1912); Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt (1922); Edwin Lefevre's Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1922); James M. Cain's hardboiled masterpiece Mildred Pierce (1941); F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel The Love of the Last Tycoon (1941); Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (1949); Sloan Wilson's The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955); Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1957); Ken Kesey's Sometimes a Great Notion (1962); Joseph Heller's Something Happened (1974); William Gaddis's J R (1975); David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1984); Michael Lewis's Liars Poker (1987); and Richard Powers' Gain (1998)."
ENGL 471: Rhetorical Traditions,"(Course content may vary by instructor). This class will introduce you to communication theories developed in classical Greece and China. Economic globalization and the increased world travel have brought Americans into direct contact with East Asian peoples and their cultures. At the same time, individuals with an East Asian linguistic and cultural background are making a strong presence in the United States. The urgency to understand East Asian peoples-their cultures, their languages, and their ways of reasoning-is being felt by a majority of Americans. This class will focus on the rhetorical traditions that have grown out of classical Greece and China. We will not only read ancient and modern texts but also watch movies produced in China and the United States to understand their philosophies, literatures, and communication arts. All readings are in English."
ENGL 482: Contemporary Literary Theory and Practice,"Contemporary literary theories and their implication for critical practice as applied to British, American, and other English-language literary works."

ENGL 50H: Introduction to Creative Writing,"This course provides students with an introduction to, and extensive practice in, creative writing in the three genres of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. The course includes instruction in principles of composition in each genre, as well as techniques of literary composition that cross and interlink those genres. If you enjoy writing to express yourself creatively--you will be at home in this course. You will also be at home here if you are an avid reader of fiction, poetry, and nonfiction, but have never tried your hand at writing it. In English 50H you will explore the genres of nonfiction, fiction, and poetry by reading published essays, short stories, and poems and by writing personal essays, sketches, scenes, and poems. We'll discuss the relationship between the genres and also discuss what makes each a distinct art form. You'll hand in regular writing assignments in addition to completing longer writing projects. You'll share some of your creative work to discuss in class. This is an honors course."
"ENGR 115N: Science, Humanity and Catastrophe: Scientific Discovery in Germany","The 20th century was a time of great scientific advancement - advancements that were used both for good and for evil (and for other purposes that lie somewhere in between). Germany and German-speaking scientists played central roles in many of these discoveries. In this course we will take an interdisciplinary approach to discussing key scientific advancements, including the discovery of nuclear fission and the development of the nuclear bomb, the discovery of polymers and the invention of pain medicines such as morphine and oxycodone, learning about the science behind these discoveries alongside the social and historical contexts in which they occurred, and the impact these discoveries had on society. While a majority of the scientific discoveries that we will focus on took place in the first half of the 20th century, we will also discuss the ways in which the long-term consequences of these discoveries are still relevant today, especially as they relate to current issues on sustainability (e.g., the use of plastics) and the ethical considerations that arise more generally when thinking about the relationship between science, technology, engineering and society. This course will count as an interdomain, GH/GN."
ENGR 291: The Role of the Engineering Peer Advising Leader,"is a 1-credit class designed to facilitate the preparation and professional development of students serving as College of Engineering Peer Advising Leaders (EPALs). EPALs support College of Engineering students through conversations about resources (Department, College, and/or University), about their individual experience as a Penn State engineering student, and about navigating the various Penn State management, registration and advising systems. Through this course, students who are training to become peer advising leaders will be familiarized with appropriate College and University resources that can support social and academic integration and success for students. Students will explore key aspects of communication in a 1-on-1 setting that will be critical to their work as an EPAL. Engineering 291 will serve to build cohesion and a shared experience culture for EPALs. The course experience will provide robust opportunities for targeted development, critical analysis, and reflection for specific professional skills relevant to the long-term success of engineering students."

This course will be offered fall, spring, and summer semesters."
ENGR 297: Special Topics,"Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."
ENGR 320Y: Design for Global Society,"examines engineering design from a societal perspective by asking the question, ""What are the responsibilities and challenges of designers in considering the needs and welfare of current and future societies, and of specific segments and groups within those societies?"" Students investigate and analyze a diverse range of perspectives on technology and consider and apply those perspectives to actual design projects and case studies.   is designed as writing-intensive with the goal of having students practice a variety of writing assignments. Those assignments include short, informal assessments and longer research papers. Also, students will work in collaborative groups on an academically-themed project related to the design intent of this course. Student teams will write proposals for projects that explore the means of environmental improvement. Teams will deliver presentations in class and at related events such as campus Earth Day celebrations.  Beyond the writing-intensive focus, the course has three other stated goals. One is to enhance student understanding by adopting a writing-to-learn approach for course assignments. The second is to help students appreciate and understand the formal design process with a focus on the diversity of the end users of their designs. The third is to have students take responsibility for their design during the process by recognizing the impact of technology on society. Meeting these goals involves readings and critical analyses in the areas of ethics, history, economy, ecology, science, and engineering."
ENGR 395: Engineering Co-Op Work Experience II,A supervised work experience where the student is employed in an engineering position in industry or government. (To be offered only for SA/UN grading.)

Students completing this course will: Acquire and apply a theoretical foundation in appropriate engineering design across cultural and international boundaries; Discuss contemporary international engineering development, ethics, and project leadership principles as they relate to intercultural communication in engineering teams; Demonstrate engineering project collaboration and leadership skills in the context of virtual cross-cultural interdisciplinary teams; Assess business and leadership skills displayed by others and critically evaluate current international events and assigned reading material. Students will be evaluated on these learning objectives through a variety of methods such as presentation of a semester long team project, critiques and reflection of relevant literature, papers, and peers reviews. This course is part of the international track within the engineering leadership development minor."
ENGR 451: Social Entrepreneurship,"Students develop business models and implementation strategies for social ventures in diverse world regions.   Social Entrepreneurship (3) Social Entrepreneurship is about pursuing direct action to address a social problem in a manner that leads to a truly sustainable solution. A similar perspective on social entrepreneurship is based on Jean-Baptiste's definition of entrepreneurs as permanent value creators. If the primary objective of value creation is positive social change, then the entrepreneur can be categorized as a social entrepreneur. Sustainability and scalability of the venture to create social change on a larger scale is essential. Metaphorically, while conventional entrepreneurs might pursue the creation of multi-million dollar enterprises, social entrepreneurs strive to create multi-million smile enterprises, while understanding that their ability to expand their social returns bears a dynamic interdependence with their economic bottom line. The mission of the venture must be strongly aligned with the measured outcomes, and this emphasis on measuring social and economic impact is crucial to the efficacy and success of social enterprises.The theory and praxis of social entrepreneurship is constantly evolving within the complex framework of political, economic and social changes occurring at the global, national and local levels in the US and other countries. Students study the dynamics of social challenges, approaches to address them, and the conceptual framework of social innovation and social entrepreneurship from theoretical and practical perspectives. Students explore technology solutions to addressing global social problems with a systems thinking approach. Case studies of successful and failed social ventures from diverse world regions and fields like healthcare, energy, food and agriculture, education, income generation, and access to capital are employed. There is an emphasis on the opportunities and challenges to multi-sectoral collaboration to address social challenges.Students learn how to develop appropriate business models and implementation strategies for a ""sustainable"" social venture. Sustainability, in this regards, refers to ventures that are technologically appropriate, environmentally benign, socially acceptable and economically sustainable. There is a specific emphasis on understanding the customers and their context and economic sustainability of the ventures. The course draws heavily from cases to understand the diverse business structures and execution strategies used by social entrepreneurs and the varied challenges faced by them. Students work in multidisciplinary cross-functional teams to develop a business/implementation model for a social venture in diverse world regions. These are real ventures that are connected to other Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) course offerings."
ENGR 467Q: Robots and Their Role in Society,"This course explores and critically analyzes the growing influence and impact of robots and automation on society. In particular, the course introduces students to the ever widening role that intelligent robots are playing and will come to play in our workplaces, on our battlefields, and in our homes. Emphasis will be placed on understanding and critically analyzing how the technical, computational, and systems role of the machine effect the behavior and values of individuals and segments of society. The course is not technical in its treatment of robots and robotics, rather the focus is on critically investigating how the development of robotic technologies have impacted society in the past, present, and future. This is an honors course."

From the oral stories of indigenous people to the journals of the first European settlers, many have looked for a way to understand their own place in the world based upon their relationship to the earth and its creatures. While Puritans often discerned the pleasure or wrath of God in the environmental changes they experienced, Transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson sought out moments of spiritual enlightenment by immersing themselves in the natural order. More recently, such poets as Galway Kinnell, James Wright, and Robert Bly have attempted to connect with the depths of collective unconsciousness by exploring the natural world, while others, like Mary Oliver, Dan Gerber, Jim Harrison, Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, have used transcendental thought and melded it with Christian and Buddhist insights. Still others, like Gary Paul Nabhan, Rachel Carson, and Alison Hawthorne Deming have brought science to bear upon the riches that nature, art, and scientific exploration may offer when joined in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of, and relationship with, the natural world. This course will acquaint students with the tradition of American nature writing, as well as contemporary nature writing, in the genres of nonfiction, poetry and fiction.

The honor students in this course will be building their strategic business plan products in electronic format in closely-knit, high performance teams. The strategic plan product development process in this course inherently involves integration across the functional areas of business: marketing, logistics, finance, and management. There is also inclusion and integration of courses in accounting, business law, management information systems, and statistics as applicable. Each student team will allocate product development responsibilities according to areas of expertise and interest. An appropriate balance of students from several majors will be assigned to each group. Class time will involve exchanging information within and across groups and coordinating activities between groups where necessary. Students will periodically meet with individual and team-based corporate mentors who will provide one-on-one advice on an as-needed basis. Students will also receive specialized training in team-based processes, leadership, and technology tools required to implement the products under development. Select members of the Penn State faculty and Smeal College alumni will be on hand at times to provide this specialized training and consulting expertise. Company owners and principals will provide periodic (monthly) reviews of honor students' work to assist them in the development of a first-class, professional business plan product."
FIN 395A: Nittany Lion Fund - Associate Fund Manager Practicum,"Nittany Lion Fund - Associate Fund Manager Practicum (3 per semester/maximum of 6) While the Lead Fund Manager is accountable for all work done by a given sector, an Associate Manager often does much of the behind the scenes work. Specific assignments include: putting together the weekly reports for investors, creating reports that are sent out to the Nittany Lion Fund (NLF), and providing assistance with pitches. In general, an Associate Manager is supposed to be well informed about the sector's current holdings and with that, an Associate should be able to provide support for the Lead Manager during a stock pitch or class discussion. Although Associate Fund Managers are the workhorses of the fund, often performing some of the more tedious tasks, the position offers the opportunity to learn from the Lead Managers as well as make an impression by delivering quality work. While Lead Managers are responsible for and have the final say in stock pitches and sector strategies, it is highly encouraged that the Associates provide their Lead Managers with pitch ideas as well as inform them of their opinions about current market trends. Ultimately, the Associate Manager position is more detail and task oriented than the Lead Fund Manager position. However, there is always room to provide high quality insight into the market by asking thought provoking questions during pitches and staying current on market news. Students use financial software, such as Bloomberg Professional, Reuters Station, TradeStation, and FactSet, and must have working knowledge of various forms of financial modeling. The Penn State Investment Association (PSIA), which co-exists with the Nittany Lion Fund, LLC (NLF) assists the NLF in ensuring students are appropriately trained in these skills. The PSIA is open to students of all majors and experience levels and is the starting point for students interested in participating in the NLF."

FIN (R EST) 409 Real Estate Finance and Investment (3) Real Estate financial markets are rapidly changing, with new instruments and ideas introduced every day. Therefore, the emphasis of this class will be on preparing the students to tackle any new instrument that might be introduced to the market, understanding why and how people make money in the field, and be able to understand and utilize the innovations that have been introduced and are still being developed. The course will provide a broad coverage of real estate investment, finance, and valuation. We will study different measures of investment performance, the impact of the financing decision on real estate investment risks and return, and various real estate financing techniques. Specific topics include: legal considerations in real estate finance, present value concepts, fixed rate mortgage loans, adjustable rate and variable payment mortgages, underwriting and financing residential properties, income-producing properties and valuation fundamentals, leases, projecting cash flows, investment value, investment and risk analysis, financial leverage and financing alternatives, disposition and renovation of income properties, financing corporate real estate, real estate capital markets, the secondary mortgage market and REITS."

FIN 426: Analysis of Interest Rates and Debt Markets,"The course starts off with a review of the time value of money concepts and the pricing of standard cash flows such as annuities, perpetuities. Next, an overview of the Treasury markets is provided with emphasis on both the primary and the secondary markets. In particular, the economics of the Treasury auctions, on-the-run/off-the-run liquidity issues, the presence of the zero lower bound, the economics of inflation-protected bonds, and other topics will be discussed at length. Students will also learn how to interpret the shapes of the nominal and the real yield curves, how to forecast short/long term future directions of rates as well as how to forecast future inflations based on nominal-real rate differentials.  The course then moves on to non-Treasury segments of the fixed income markets: forward contracts, repurchasing agreements, floating rate notes, swaps, single stock futures, corporate bonds. For each topic, standard pricing techniques and relevant practical issues will be discussed. For example, how can a fixed income investor price a bond newly issued by a corporation based on their past equity market performance, using techniques typically employed by Moody's KMV? How does an investor gauge the potential illiquidity of a bond when transaction data are sparse? Or how one can extract a measure of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) from the single stock futures markets? Or how a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) could hedge interest rate risks using standard duration and convexity hedging techniques even in a quick moving environment when assumptions underlying these techniques are likely, to varying degrees, violated.  The final third of the course deals with relatively more advanced topics. Students are introduced to the use of risk-neutral probability measures in pricing fixedincome derivative products (callable bonds, treasury futures, swaptions) in the context of a binomial tree. For example, students learn how to use calibrated binomial trees of interest rates to accommodate bonds¿ callable features, how to compute/interpret the options-adjusted spreads, how to account for various institutional features of the Treasury bonds futures markets and why futures and forward prices may differ when bonds are the underlying assets. The class finishes with a topic on Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and the economics of their mispricing prior to the Great Recession."

Students examine these securities with regard to duration, convexity, credit risk, and formal term structure models. Various data sources and financial software, including Bloomberg Professional ®, are used to integrate theoretical concepts with practical applications. The aim of this course is to provide you with an introduction to the valuation of fixed income securities and the management of fixed income investment portfolios. In their simplest form, fixed income securities are characterized by pre-determined cash-flows that occur at fixed points in time, thus the term ""fixed income"". Coupon bonds are the most widely recognized fixed income securities. We will start with the basics of bond pricing - the relationship between the price of a bond, measures of return on the bond, and measures of risk. The tools for the valuation of bonds, fixed income derivatives and credit derivatives will be covered. With these building blocks in place, we will discuss bond portfolio management and construction."

FIN 495B: Nittany Lion Fund - Executive Board Practicum,"- Nittany Lion Fund - Executive Board Practicum (3 per semester/maximum of 6) The Executive Board practicum affords students with intense practical experience in oversight and performance of the Nittany Lion Fund (NLF). Executive Board members and Directors are accountable for all aspects of the NLF. An Associate Fund Manager is responsible for all work that is presented to his or her Lead Fund Manager and in turn, a Lead Fund Manager is responsible for all work that is submitted for the Nittany Lion Fund (NLF) to view. While those are certainly tremendous responsibilities, an Executive Board Member is ultimately responsible for any and every document that leaves the Nittany Lion Fund, most of which are delivered to investors. It is the responsibility of the Executive Board to make sure that both the weekly news, and quarterly performance releases are flawless. Additionally, although the Lead Fund Managers are responsible for their individual sector's performance, the Executive Board is held responsible for the overall performance of the Nittany Lion Fund. This means that the Executive Board must do a number of things to keep performance awareness and accountability at high levels. Students in these executive positions are expected to ask excellent questions during stock pitches and be, in a sense, a devil's advocate for each pitch, making sure that there was proper due diligence and thought put into the strategy of the pitch. With regard to being accountable to investors, the Executive Board is responsible for conducting weekly conference calls with the NLF's investment committee as well as leading the yearly investor meeting. As for the PSIA, the Executive Board is responsible for booking locations for meetings, handling the funds for all club transactions, and developing and implementing the education for the analysts to become PSIA certified. Education is a very large part of the Nittany Lion Fund. An Executive Board Member is expected to utilize their past experience to provide helpful influence to other members of the Nittany Lion Fund as well as the large group of PSIA members. While the members of the Executive Board all have different responsibilities, in aggregate the group is responsible for the performance of Nittany Lion Fund as a whole, as well as being individual figureheads and spokesmen for the NLF."
FINSV 420: Estate Planning for the Financial Services Professional,"Studies the processes relating to the use, conservation, and transfer of an individual's wealth; emphasizing investments, insurance and taxation.   Estate Planning for the Financial Services Professional (3) This course examines the why and how people plan for their retirement. The course examines the various aspects of estate planning: wills and trusts, estate and gift tax planning, estate administration and taxation. The course guides the student in a step-by-step process through the entire estate planning process. Critical to the process is gathering the necessary financial facts, setting realistic objectives, and planning the requisite income tax and investment strategies.

FOR 409: Tree Physiology,"Fundamentals of the relationship of the basic physiological functions of forest trees to form. Tree Physiology is the study of how trees grow and develop in terms of genetics; biochemistry; cellular, tissue, and organ functions; and interaction with environmental factors. While many physiological processes are similar in trees and other plants, trees possess unique properties that help determine their outward appearance. These processes include carbon relations (photosynthesis, carbohydrate allocation), cold and drought resistance, water relations, and mineral nutrition. The characteristics of trees that define their physiology are longevity, height, and simultaneous reproductive and vegetative growth. Trees have physiological processes that are more adaptable than those in other plants. Height allows trees to successfully compete for light, but also creates transport and support problems. This course investigates the anatomy, morphology and physiology of growth, development, and responses of woody plants with particular consideration of the influence of environmental factors on physiological processes. To develop an understanding of tree physiology the following topics will be presented: Organization, development, and function of woody plant tissues Photosynthesis, respiration, and assimilation in forest trees Water relations and mineral nutrition. Tree growth responses to atmospheric and soil condition. Physiology variation among tree species. Herbicides and tree physiology. Methods and tools of tree physiology research."
"FOR 418: Agroforestry: Science, Design, and Practice","Agroforestry integrates trees in agricultural landscapes, and/or agriculture products into forested areas for multiple benefits.   Agroforestry: Science, Design, and Practice (3) (US;IL) Agroforestry is the intentional design of land use systems that combine tree crops with plants and/or animals in a manner that seeks to promote ecological and economic benefits within the landscape. Two possible arrangements for such systems are (1) the integration of trees within non-forested settings; and/or (2) the introduction of high value 'crop' species into existing forestlands. The objective of the course is to foster a practical working knowledge of agroforestry as it is experienced both in Pennsylvania and throughout the world, so that students from a variety of backgrounds can integrate agroforestry practices and thinking into their own disciplines, interests, and lives. Although agroforestry is an ancient land use approach, it is new in many places, and improvements and adaptations to traditional practices are needed to meet local circumstances. This course will provide a framework for critical assessment and implementation within this context.One of the fundamental aspects of agroforestry is that it is a land use system that operates at a landscape or ecosystem scale. For agroforestry to succeed, many factors, including ones external to the agroforestry practice itself must be considered. Therefore the course is interdisciplinary in nature and topics in ecology, economics, sociology, and policy that are related to agroforestry practices will be discussed. In evaluating the students, the primary emphasis is on class discussion. Students will be expected to review and discuss papers and contribute to the ongoing dialogue and debate about agroforestry as a sustainable land use. Students will be required to carry out critical reviews of agroforestry papers and publications as well as design and develop an agroforestry project pertinent to their individual field of interest and expertise. The course will be offered every Spring semester."

French Semantics (3) The aim of this course is to provide upper level undergraduate students in French with a relatively informal introduction to the field of semantics as it applies to the French language. Semantics is the subfield of theoretical linguistics that seeks to make explicit the rules native speakers use to interpret stable aspects of the meaning of natural language sentences. The course will begin by comparing and contrasting semantic and pragmatic aspects of meaning -an important undertaking since only the former are assumed to be subject to invariable rules of grammar. The conclusions reached in this portion of the course will then be extended to account for a very special type of language -humor -in a particular context, France. That as, it will be shown that a more complete understanding of this linguistic behavior entails recognition of the relative contributions of pragmatics and semantics. We will then turn to a survey of the classic model-theoretic approach to lexical and compositional aspects of semantic meaning, with important (sociolinguistic) refinements to the standard approach to lexical semantics being discussed in detail. With a survey of the fundamentals of the field in place, we will then undertake an investigation of specific topics in semantics, looking first at the status of thematic roles in semantic theory (focusing on work by David Dowty). Here we will examine the important implications his work holds for the initial mapping of arguments into sentence structure, not only for primary transitive verbs, but also unaccusative and psych-verbs. We will then examine current analyses of causation in French, certain aspectual distinctions, and semantic, pragmatic, and syntactic approaches to negative and positive polarity items, n-words, and minimizers."

They then follow the collected evidence as it is disseminate throughout the crime lab for examination and analysis. Disciplines such as forensic serology, trace evidence, impression evidence, drug chemistry, toxicology, and DNA will be discussed. Students will learn about the examinations performed by crime lab professionals; the application of scientific principles from disciplines such biology, chemistry, physics, and math to those exams; and the instrumentation commonly used in the lab to complete those examinations and analyses. At every step of the process, students will learn about the need for photographs as both documentation and evidence, as well as the different types of photographs, photography, and cameras common to forensic work. Once the evidence has bee processed, students will use critical thinking skills to interpret evidence within the context of at least one case. They will reconstruct a crime as it could have occurred guided by the results and conclusions generated from their analyses.

This course will focus on the myriad ways that narrative arts and physical sciences relate to the development of technologically mediated virtual worlds. Designing the physical and narrative voyages of avatars through virtual worlds is necessarily a team-centered undertaking requiring recursive editing from a macroscopic and microscopic point of view to refocus project goals and deliverables. Besides learning the requisite computing and technical skills involved in virtual world development, students enrolled in this course will produce a world design proposal, and storyboards, interactive fiction graphics, or world maps for their virtual world; in this way, they will explore some of the ways that creative writing, particularly interactive fiction and storytelling techniques drawn from non-VR and VR gaming contribute to the planning, design, and execution of virtual worlds. Students will also learn about the basic science behind virtual world concepts such as the physical environment, physical processes (e.g. kinematics, motion), and light; ultimately, they will produce an immersive time-space experience in their proposed world and reflect on the complexity of integrating design elements in a way that creates a satisfying immersive experience. The objectives of the course include: (1) students will work in teams to design a proposed virtual world using world making principles found in interactive fiction narratology and physical principles that embody the avatar and allow it to move in a virtual world environment; (2) students will work in teams to construct a virtual scene, movement in time/space, from that world using computer software tools and mediated through virtual reality hardware; (3) students will be able to discuss developing immersive technology and applications of virtual worlds in business, society, and academia; (4) students will analyze and critique the virtual world designs of other student teams; (5) students will demonstrate comprehension of interactive fiction scene and level structures and world maps as they relate to designing the voyage of the avatar in a virtual world; and (6) students will demonstrate comprehension of physical principles (e.g. kinematics, light) as they apply to virtual worlds. In addition to directed readings, discussions, and quizzes in computing, narrative arts, and physics (related to concepts inherent in virtual worlds), the course will incorporate hands-on lab exercises and online discussions. A semester-long team project will be the primary means of student evaluation. During this semester-long team project students will design and create their own virtual environment(s) and character(s) using software tools and accepted world design principles.

GEOG 1N: Global Parks and Sustainability,"This course uses parks and protected areas - both in the U.S. and globally - as a framework for exploring broad themes of sustainability, conservation, and socio-ecological systems. Case studies that exemplify U.S. and international parkscapes (i.e., parks and protected areas embedded within complex landscapes) are used to convey stories of evolving attitudes and approaches toward conservation and sustainability. These stories help explain the historical, transitioning, and future role of conservation in societies shaped by local ecologies, conflict, and change. The unique geographies of conservation parkscapes- past and future -reinforce and challenge a globally dynamic conservation discourse. Examining the sustainability of conservation activities themselves, as well as the socio-ecological systems in which they are embedded, can provide a lens through which we can begin to understand other cultures, aesthetic values and value systems, and the diverse ecologies of Earth. In this course, we will: - Explore the history of parks and protected areas globally, including the development of the U.S. National Park system, and the globalization of conservation and sustainability policies and approaches - Examine globally representative case-studies to assess how parks and protected areas are part of both social and ecological landscapes (""parkscapes"") - Assess new challenges and opportunities for conservation in an era of rapid change and conflict - Evaluate the history, current socio-ecological condition, and future approaches in sustainability for a particular global parkscape By the end of the course students should be able to: - Describe why the idea of `wilderness' is both influential and contested - Explain temporal and spatial trends in national and international conservation management - Compare and contrast contemporary conservation approaches - Illustrate a parkscape as a coupled socio-ecological system - Identify key drivers of future ecological change affecting conservation management"

GEOG 310W: Introduction to Global Climatic Systems,"Introduction to global atmospheric circulation, including tropical, midlatitude and polar subsystems; ocean, land, cryospheric and urban climatic systems and interactions.    Introduction to Global Climatic Systems (3) Geography 310W is an advanced undergraduate course in Climatology that emphasizes study of the patterns of interannual climate variability ( climate fluctuations ) and the physical processes responsible for those variations ( climate dynamics ). Interannual climate variations include regional- to large-scale anomalies of temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, etc., that become manifest as drought, floods, heat and cold waves, etc. The physical processes associated with climate fluctuations include the following: interactions among the climate-system components (atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere); external forcing (e.g., solar variations, volcanic activity); and long-distance interactions involving the coupled atmospheric-ocean circulations, orteleconnections(El Ni�o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and the Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern). Climatic teleconnections manifest shifts in the atmospheric pressure ""centers of action"", storm tracks, jet stream positions, etc. In addition to the study of these climate patterns and processes, the course examines the role of human activities in climate, particularly ""global warming"", desertification, deforestation and afforestation, urbanization, irrigation for agriculture, and aviation impacts. In this regard, a key issue that is addressed is the potential role of human activities on the frequency and intensity of teleconnections, such as ENSO, and of severe storms (thunderstorms, tornadoes) and hurricanes; possibly the result of modifications to the oceanic Thermo-Haline Circulation. Students write a term paper, as well as critiques of a number of published articles relating to the above topics in climate dynamics. There is a mid-term (essay) exam but no final exam."

You will have an opportunity in this course to: learn how tousestatistics in your own work; learn how toconsumestatistics in everyday life The statistical methods you will learn to use are simple descriptive statistics that we use to summarize complex data, as well as the associated charts, diagrams and maps. From there, we will move on to look at chance and probability theory, and simple inferential statistics.Throughout the course, we will be concerned with &ldquo;everyday statistics&rdquo;, primarily as it relates to geography. Contemporary media are saturated with statistics, from reports of climatic change, through latest presidential election polls, to batting averages and yards-gained statistics in sports. A lot of the presentation of these statistics is lazy or inaccurate, and often misleading (whether, deliberately or not), and a major theme of this course will be to look at the issues involved.During most lectures we will spend some time working with sample problems, and to discuss practical applications. These activities are meant to build a deeper understanding of the subject matter but it also relies heavily on your active participation. You will often have work to prepare before lectures or other types of lecture homework.Labs will give you experience with statistics functions in Excel before moving onto SPSS as well as other statistical software, and also with mapping statistical data using GIS software."

GEOG 410: Climatic Change and Variability,"This course introduces students to the physical dimensions of climate change and variability over a variety of temporal and spatial scales. The focus is on recent and future global warming, but we will spend some time looking at climate changes of the past, as context for the future. The emphasis is on the physical science behind questions of global and regional climate changes, but we will also pay some attention to shorter-period climate variations/teleconnections and their impacts on human systems (as possible analogs of future climate change). Because scientific discovery and analysis takes place within a particular social context, we will consider the values, ethics and responsibilities of scientists in general, and specifically in the contexts of geoengineering to minimize or reverse global climate changes. Climate change topics include radiative forcing, greenhouse gases and aerosols, scenario development using statistical and dynamical approaches, equilibrium GCMs versus time-dependent models. Important climate variation topics are droughts, floods, heat/cold waves, and the role of teleconnections; notably, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic/Antarctic Oscillations. Because most professional research on climate change and variation involves collaborative science teams, this course emphasizes collaboration and participation. Course Objectives 1. Provide students a basic understanding of the climate system and the internal and external forcings that produces climate variability and change over varying time scales. 2. Introduce students to the tools of the trade how statistical and global climate models work and why they are used. 3. Help students to think critically about global climate change projections and their implications for natural and human systems. 4. Improve students' skills in communicating science concepts for a variety of audiences. Learning Outcomes As a result of taking the course, students should have an increased understanding of global climate change and its potential impacts on society, including: 1. Understand, and be able to explain to others, the physical basis for future global climate change. 2. Be able to set future changes in the context of past climate change and variability. 3. Understand the influence of national and international organizations in structuring climate change research and possible remedies. 4. Articulate their own values, ethics and world view and recognize how these frame their own understanding and perspectives on climate change issues."

GEOG 433: Geographies of Justice,"The justice concept has been a topic of interest within various academic and policy realms concerned with the inequities experienced by racial groups, socio-economic class, and ethnicity. The environment justice movement is generally understood to have begun in the early 1980s with a series of events that demonstrated the inequitable distribution of health hazards and risk. While much work in environmental justice has usefully focused on the disproportionate exposure of poor and minority populations to environmental hazards, conceptualizations of justice have expanded in recent years to include systematic and comparative research within urban and rural populations, industrialized and developing contexts, access to and control over resources, as well as unwilling exposure to hazards, processes and institutions of environmental governance. These trends have resulted in greater attention to the social processes that create and perpetuate inequality on the basis of race, gender, income, or other social categories. In exploring the 'fast conceptual transfer' of the environmental justice concept to other settings, Walker and Bulkeley (2006: 655) suggest emerging interest in distribution between nation-states, an expansion of terms to include gender, age and future generations, and intersections with the vulnerability literatures to examine the threat of natural and produced risks. This course engages with the history and future of social and environmental justice. We begin by examining the emergence of the environmental justice movement in the United States and subsequent export of the justice concept to other topics, including sustainable development and climate change, and within other settings, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In exploring the diverse ways that justice is being applied at the present time, we will also question the future viability for justice as a conceptual and organizational tool. Course Objectives This course has four primary objectives: - Examine the history of the concept of environmental justice and the environmental justice movement in the United States; - Consider multiple definitions of environmental justice such as procedural and distributive justice; - Examine the application of the environmental justice concept to other topics, including sustainable development and climate change, and within other settings, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America; and - Consider future directions for environmental justice."
GEOG 434: Politics of the Environment,"This course explores politics related to the use, transformation, valuation, and representation of the environment.  GEOG 434GEOG 434 Politics of the Environment (3) Scholarship in geography and related disciplines has demonstrated that nature in general and specific environments in particular are unavoidably political. Environmental management can thus never be a purely scientific or technological challenge; it requires critical analysis of cultural, political, and economic contexts, factors, and effects. For instance, effective environmental management requires consideration of how culture shapes how we perceive and value our environments, who wins and who loses in any particular approach to environmental management, and what the relative advantages and disadvantages of competing institutional approaches to environmental management are.This course examines the development of environmental governance, with a primary focus on the United States. It explores both how various groups within society conceive of and value the environment, and multiple approaches to environmental governance and protection. It reviews the history of environmental movements and regulation, and contemporary issues and debates in environmental governance, with particular attention to the effects of institutional forms and social movements. In particular, it examines competing arguments for and against governance approaches centered on state action, market mechanisms, and prominent roles for NGOs and social movements.Students will be evaluated based on: 1) their participation in class discussions, based on critical engagement with material from course readings and lectures; 2) their performance on a midterm and a final examination; 3) an individual research project on a topic relevant to the course, to be designed and carried out under the supervision of the course instructor."
"GEOG 436: Ecology, Economy, and Society","Analyses of major themes in ecology and economic development, poverty- alleviation, and sustainability.  GEOG 436GEOG 436 Ecology, Economy, and Society (3) For many years, it was believed that there was a direct tradeoff between economic growth and a clean environment. Sustainable development has been proposed as an framework within which these two objectives can be pursued in harmony and actually can reinforce one another. This course focuses on sustainability issues at the broader (macroeconomic) level, as opposed to the operation of individual businesses (microeconomic, or industrial ecology) level.The course will have two main emphases: 1) to evaluate the major conceptual ideas surrounding natural resource management and sustainable development, including equity, poverty, fairness, power, knowledge, and community empowerment; 2) to use empirical case studies to examine the practical, material and policy relevance of these concepts. The first part of the semester will be used to untangle and clarify the ideological and theoretical bases (biases) of broad human-environment discourses as they pertain to community empowerment and resource development. The final part of the semester will be used to analyze case studies in order to assess the relevance of existing theoretical framework for resource empowerment and community development in industrialized countries and the Third World, especially Africa."
GEOG 437W: Energy Geographies and Policy,"This course explores the motivations, key concepts, and contemporary challenges of US and international energy policy. The approach of the course is inherently geographical in that we engage the concepts of scale, place, landscape, and materiality to evaluate energy policy issues. The course addresses the following questions: 1) Why and how is energy governed? 2) How does energy policy differ across political scales and energy sectors? 3) Who are the key stakeholders influencing energy policy? 4) How are the costs and benefits of energy policy distributed? 5) How can a geographic perspective advance energy policy making? 6) How well do existing tools and policy frameworks address emerging challenges in energy policy and governance? The course is designed to explore these questions through interactive discussion, drawing on examples from various political levels and in various geographical contexts. A combination of independent writing and presentations will provide students with the expertise to be careful and critical observers of policy developments, and to prepare students for future roles as policy advisors in business and government settings. The course is divided into four parts: 1) overview of US and international energy policy; 2) key concepts and debates in analyzing energy; 3) case studies; and 4) emerging issues and challenges.

GEOG 439: Property and the Global Environment,"This course reviews theoretical and empirical relationships between multiple legal, economic, and cultural approaches to property, and environmental quality and conflicts.  GEOG 439GEOG 439 Property and the Global Environment (3) Property relations are among the most powerful and pervasive institutions in human societies. Fundamental rules governing and legitimating who can do what, and where, they shape and reveal interactions between human societies and physical environments, a concern at the heart of geography. Our own property relations are often all but invisible to us precisely because they are so deeply woven into our perceptions, consciousness, social structures, and everyday experiences of the world. It is thus easy to overlook the fact that we live within highly specific and contingent property arrangements and that changing circumstances are prompting important changes in contemporary property relations.This course explores these issues with a particular focus on their implications for environmental politics and regulation. We will address questions such as: Is the privatization and commodification of nature a recipe for ecological disaster, or the most effective means of preservation? Can we own the weather? What were the historical-geographical circumstances surrounding the development of major modern property forms, and are those forms adequate to the environmental problems we now confront? Are there property relationships outside of the law? How do property relations and conflicts change in response to changing human control over nature, and how can different kinds of property arrangements lead to, or help to solve, environmental and social problems? Readings will review debates over common property; the benefits and dangers of privatization of environmental goods; distinctions between formal and informal property rights; the development of zoning and other regulation of private property; and contemporary debates over intellectual property rights in nature, and relationships among trade, property rights, and environmental quality.The course will be of interest to students interested in environmental policy, land use planning and management, law, the areas of nature-society relations and historical geography, and environmental history. Students will gain a sophisticated understanding of the central underpinnings of much property and environmental regulation, and familiarity with many cutting-edge debates in these domains, both domestically and internationally. Evaluation methods will include examinations and an independent research paper and presentation by each student. The course will be offered every other year, with enrollment capped at 30 students."
GEOG 493: Service Learning,"Classroom instruction with supervised student activity on a group community service project.  GEOG 493GEOG 493 Service Learning (3-12) , Service Learning, provides students with activities that integrate community service with academic study. The aim of service learning is to enrich traditional classroom-based education by getting students into a community, thereby engendering civic responsibility and simultaneously strengthening communities.  has five objectives: (1) to develop understanding of a set of issues; (2) to learn and apply skills associated with those issues; (3) to learn to interpret science issues for dissemination to the public; (4) to develop and apply communication skills by speaking, writing, and/or desktop publishing; and (5) to reflect on personal and career interests in science, the environment, public policy, or related areas. Thus, students will read, write, and talk about a set of issues of importance to a community and engage in a project in that community.The specific service-learning projects will change each semester, although some projects will be ongoing. In addition, more than one  project will be available to students in most semesters and will have alphabetical designations (e.g., 493A or 493B). Students can take GEOG in more than one semester, to a maximum of 12 credits.Depending on the topic of the service-learning project,  can complement courses in most colleges and their majors. The course is available to all Geography majors as elective credits; it is also available to all Geography Minors for credit toward the minor. It counts for credit as an Advanced Physical/Environmental Geography course in the Physical/Environmental Geography Option, and counts for credit as an Advanced Geography course in the General Geography Option.Students will be evaluated on four of the five course objectives: (1) understanding of the issues, (2) learning and application of skills, (3) interpretation of issues for public dissemination, and (4) application of communication skills. Although exact procedures for determining grades will vary with the instructor and service-learning project, the basis for grades will include a combination of written work, oral presentations, in-class participation, and outside-class participation."

Physical Processes in Geology applies basic principles from physics and mathematics to explore and understand the Earth and the processes that operate within the Earth and at the Earth's surface. The course includes the study of Earth's gravity and magnetic fields, focusing on how they reveal the internal structures and dynamics related to plate tectonics. The basic physics and mathematics of plate motions are also explored in some detail. We will also examine the elastic properties and behaviors of rocks, which form the basis for understanding seismic waves, rock fracture, and fault slip. The next major topic of the class is the flow of heat through the solid Earth system, involving the study of conduction, convection, and advection. The study of heat will provide the basis for understanding the application of simple differential equations with boundary conditions to geological processes; this will also introduce the mathematics of diffusion, which will permeate much of the course. This study of diffusion will enable us to move from steady state conditions to non-steady state conditions that typify most geological settings. We will examine the fluid dynamics relevant to the flow of the mantle and less viscous fluids at the surface such as lava flows and glaciers. The fluid dynamics will also lead us into an exploration of the basic physics of ocean circulation, stream flow, and erosion on land. Throughout the course, students will learn how to use calculus and very simple computer programming in MATLAB to provide a quantitative framework for understanding the physical processes that shape the Earth. The class involves a weekly lab that involves several field trips to make measurements using a variety of geophysical instruments to solve problems related to gravity, stream flow, and heat flow. Other lab activities involve studies of rock friction and fracture, ocean currents, glacial flow, seismology, and plate motions."

GEOSC 402 Natural Disasters (3) (IL)(WAC) Is anywhere safe from natural disasters? Can we hide, or should we learn to live with the hazards around us? This course will explore the causes, effects, and societal response to disasters. By learning from previous disasters, we can develop strategies to avert the disasters or at a minimum mitigate their affects. We will look at a variety of natural hazards and related disasters including flooding, volcanoes, landslides, earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunami. By the sue of case studies of recent occurences of natural disasters, we will determine how damaging disasters can be, and what we can do to minmimize their impact on society. This course will provide an in-depth, hands-on study of natural hazards, their geography, and their impact on societies worldwide. We will focus on both the physical processes (e.g. underlying geoglogy or geophysics) of selected natural hazards and the humn systems that have developed to minimize the impact of natural disasters.The course will place emphasis on active learning exercises to investigate processes and responses to natural hazards. We will meet for two periods each week which will include both lecture and group research activities (approximately 30% of time is in lectures, 70% time is in group research activities). Grading will be based on reports for each topic, a disaster diary, and a term report. The term report is an independent project which focuses on a selected city facing significant natural hazards. Cities will be selected from both the developed and developing world to allow comparsions of the impacts of natural disasters under different socio-economic and cultural conditions.The course is offered once each year with a target enrollment of 25-30 students.Prerequisites for the course are at least 6 credits in science courses (inluding GN courses)."

GLIS 101N: Globalization,"This course provides a broad introduction to the topic of global studies. This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.This interdisciplinary course explores how people and nations confront the phenomenon of globalization, presenting different perspectives for studying and making sense of the world. Students are exposed to a variety of analytical approaches from the arts, humanities and social sciences to allow them to see how different perspectives portray the world, interpret events, and often shape human actions. The course begins from a humanities perspective, exploring the concept of social identity, in particular understanding how people in different cultures develop a sense of their identity and how this is perpetuated over time through a society's products, practices, and perspectives (e.g. artifacts, value systems, traditions). The focus then shifts to organizations in society, comparing how they operate with either national or global identities. This leads to an exploration of how information and communication technologies are tools to create both global connectivity, yet can also be a source of division. Globalization is then considered in terms of its impact on the natural environment, populations, and health. Challenges arising in each of these areas are the concern of all global citizens, and are explored in terms of how interdependencies are increasing their impact. The focus of the course progresses to gender, poverty, and human rights, exploring these in tandem with their literary representations, presented in both global and comparative contexts. Economic development models are also used to uncover trends in gender and poverty. The final focus is on global peace and conflict, highlighting how globalization, in bringing people and nations closer together, can also give rise to conflict and division. This course is one of two 100-level courses that are required for the GLIS major. While this course focuses on a general introduction to global studies as a field of study,  complements the topics raised here, exploring many from a range of different perspectives to prepare students for choosing their options through the major."

This course is designed to provide an in-depth examination of family policy. Students will identify and critically analyze major issues, controversies, and policies that affect families. Attention will be devoted to recognizing both intended and unintended consequences of family policies and understanding policy challenges and trade-offs. Students will gain an understanding of how policies are shaped by both facts and myths, as well as our values. Students will examine historical and current trends in family patterns (e.g., divorce, women's labor force participation, nonmarital births) to understand the implications they hold for individuals, families and society. Students will gain an awareness of the social, economic, historical, legal, and political contexts within which family policies exist and are proposed. Although the main focus is on U.S. family policy, some time will be devoted to learning about family policies in other countries. We will learn about several specific family policies in-depth (e.g., welfare), but a final goal is to help students develop a general way of looking at family policy that they can then use to understand any issue of family policy that unfolds throughout their lifetime. This course will foster thoughtful reflection and critical thinking, writing skills, research skills, and skills of synthesis, logic, and argument. Course goals will be accomplished through course readings, writing assignments, lectures, class discussions, debates and group projects. Mastery of course material and student evaluation are assessed in several ways. Students will take a midterm and final exam that cover lectures, class discussions, and assigned readings. Two papers are also required. The first paper is based on an analysis of newspaper articles dealing with family policy issues that students will collect and relate to course materials.

HIST 118: Modern Jewish History,"Modern Jewish history is a complex and fascinating story. Some scholars depicted it as a long period of suffering and isolation that culminated in the Holocaust and only ended with the founding of the state of Israel. In recent decades a more balanced perspective has found wide acceptance. Today scholars highlight Jewish agency and different conditions in the various places Jews settled without downplaying anti-Jewish prejudice and violence. A recurring theme in this course concerns the relationship between individual Jews and Jewish communities, and on a broader level, the perception and treatment of Jews by societies and states. As Jews in Western and Central Europe ""left the Ghetto"" around 1800 and became citizens of states, they redefined their relationship to Jewish communities in strikingly different ways. Some Jewish women and men emerged as agents of change, others resisted change. We will explore Jewish ""responses to modernity,"" ranging from assimilation, Zionism, and socialism to migration. While many Jews in Western Europe and the United States prospered, the lives of Jews (and their neighbors) in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire were shaped by social and economic crisis (albeit not constantly and not everywhere). For the twentieth century the course will concentrate on three major events that had a dramatic impact on Jews, especially in Europe: the First World War and the collapse of the large multiethnic Empires in Eastern Europe, the Holocaust and the founding of the first modern Jewish state, Israel."

"HIST 182: Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia","An historical overview of economy, industrialization, globalization and capitalism in Asia from the 16th century to present.  ASIA (HIST) 182 Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Asian economies have experienced spectacular growth in the second half of the 20th century. But this growth is part of a longer story of Asian commerce and trade and its relationship to and integration with (and, in some cases, isolation from) global patterns of exchange. Moreover, these exchanges are best understood alongside the politics, society, and culture--sometimes local, sometimes regional--that shaped trade and business in entrepots, capitals, and hinterlands throughout Asia. This course begins with a historical exploration of the economic development and social change and ends by asking what lies in store for one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economic regions. By offering a historical frame for Asian economic experience , students will gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of prevailing theories that tend to overstate centralized control, market mechanisms, and cultural determination. Asian economies and markets are quite diverse, consisting of emerging and mature markets, making it difficult to view them through a single lens. As a result this course seeks to introduce students to a variety of conceptual frameworks in these countries. Examinations of the major economic players China, India, and Japan form the backbone of the course, but the precise geographic emphasis will vary with instructor, and may also include discussions of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other Asian states. Themes of the course will vary depending on instructor, but may include industrialization, sustainability and the environment, gender and labor, protest and political reform, and consumerism and advertising, among others.

HIST 212N: Earthquakes and Human History,"A natural disaster is the result of a natural hazard impinging upon human society. In this course we examine seismicity as a geophysical phenomenon and as a natural hazard that interacts with the built environment and the social structures of human societies. Whenever possible, we approach this subject historically. Among other topics, we examine the history of how earthquakes have been understood as well as the impact of earthquakes and seismicity on the history and development of certain societies. Our specific perspectives include: Earthquakes as understood by modern and contemporary earth science Major conceptions of earthquakes in the past Impacts of seismic hazards on the built environment of past societies Impacts of seismic hazards on politics, economic development and social policies of past societies Seismic hazards, earthquake-related technology, and contemporary societies By examining earthquakes in these ways, the study of earthquakes becomes a vehicle for enhancing skills in analytical reasoning. In particular, this course focusses on applications of modern scientific analysis and the approaches commonly employed in historical investigation. Specific skills addressed in this course include, processing and quantifying information, problem solving using evidence and sound reasoning, and expressing ideas with clarity. Immersion in the study of earthquakes affords an opportunity to think more broadly about how people have dealt with natural disasters in the past and to explore the roles that science, technology, and social policy play in defining and addressing natural hazards in contemporary societies and in the future. Class meetings include lectures, discussions, and in-class activities. We analyze scientific observations that have led to increased understanding of earthquakes, earthquake hazards and risk. We also make extensive use of case studies as concrete examples of different types of earthquakes, the historical evolution of ideas about earthquakes, and the range of social impacts of earthquakes. Reading assignments provide essential background for class sessions."
HIST 245: Middle Eastern Cities,"This class explores the history of Middle Eastern and North African cities in the 19th-21st centuries.

HIST 261Y: Ghetto: From Venice to Detroit,"This course explores why certain groups have been segregated in cities around the world in the last 500 years.  HIST (J ST) 261Y Ghetto: From Venice to Detroit (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course examines the history of segregated and demarcated districts for certain groups of people within cities (and metropolitan regions) in the last five hundred years in different parts of the world. The course identifies factors that led to the establishment of segregated (and often demarcated) districts -and their eventual dissolution (or transformation). The course traces the social and political impact of exclusion within the segregated district, the possibilities of making contacts beyond the district, the function of innovation and cultural production emanating from these urban areas, and the conceptual trajectory of the Ghetto concept from Renaissance Venice to post-industrial Detroit. Cities and states have allowed certain groups to settle within their confines for economic benefit but have imposed severe restrictions to safeguard the respective city's and/or the state's cultural, political, and ""racial"" integrity. The course will present several representative case studies of segregated and demarcated districts in European, North American, Asian and African cities, highlighting strikingly different trajectories and purposes behind the spatial segregation of people categorized as different and threatening but also as useful. Comparing the case studies will lead to a discussion about the transformation of the Ghetto concept between 1517 and the present. Following a discussion of the Ghetto concept and an overview of urban history since 1500 we will study Jewish Ghettos in early and late Renaissance Italy and Central Europe. For comparison we will discuss the history of Dutch and Portuguese trade colonies in Japan around 1600. The second part of the course will focus on Jewish and other immigrant neighborhoods in late 19th century New York and Chicago. Before moving to the origins of the 20th century ""Black Ghetto"" (Chicago, Detroit) four related cases will be discussed: Chinatowns in the United States; residential segregation in colonial cities in South and East Asia, Nazi Ghettos in Poland and the Soviet Union; and townships in South Africa during the Apartheid period. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches, placing some emphasis on the use of theoretical texts written by historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists."
HIST 292N: Witches and Witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the Present,"This course will explore the social and cultural history of witches and witchcraft from the late Middle ages in Europe and the U.S. to the present. The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as fictions: figures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and films, fictional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and fiction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do fictions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, and in opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities. The course will be organized chronologically and move back and forth between history, such as the Salem witch trials, and the representations of that history in art, literature and film. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual arts, from the engravings of German Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the gothic paintings of Francisco Goya during the Romantic period, to contemporary artist Louise Bourgeois' monument to those executed as witches in Norway. The course will end with analysis of images of witches in popular culture, movies and television, and with a discussion of the modern representations of the domesticated witch and the femme fatale."

HIST 480: Japan in the Age of Warriors,"An overview of Japan from the 10th to 17th century, a period of political decentralization, cultural efflorescence, and social change.  ASIA (HIST) 480 Japan in the Age of Warriors (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. By the eighth century, Japan had become a centralized state centered on the reign of a sovereign, commonly known in English as an emperor. At the end of the ninth century, the emperor&rsquo;s court relocated to the city of Heian (Kyoto), and soon thereafter, an elegant court culture developed in the capital. The courtly culture was based on civilian values and civilian rule. In the countryside, however, Japan was gradually becoming militarized. Local warlords began rising to prominence and vying with each other for power. One of them, Taira-no-Masakado, rebelled against the central government during the years 939-940, declaring himself &ldquo;emperor&rdquo; of several provinces in eastern Japan centered on Hitachi. Although the central government in Kyoto enlisted other warrior groups to put down Taira-no-Masakado&rsquo;s rebellion, the process of militarization was underway. Buddhist temples also participated in this process, using their wealth and influence to assemble monastic armies on occasion. This course examines Japanese history beginning approximately in the 10th century, at time when civilian high culture in the capital was approaching the height of its development. At the same time, the process of militarization of the countryside was beginning to undermine that civilian court culture. The course ends in approximately the seventeenth century with the establishment of a military government under the Tokugawa shoguns. This development was ostensibly the peak of warrior influence, with the samurai (=warrior) class entrenched by law as the elite group within society. However, just as the warriors began their rise to power in the tenth century, by the end of the seventeenth century they were rapidly losing influence and prestige to wealthy merchants as the forces of the market economy spread throughout Japanese society.  is a course in medieval Japanese history, broadly defined. Different instructors will emphasize different aspects of Japanese history and culture during this era. Approaches to teaching will also vary depending on the instructor.

INART 10: The Popular Arts in America:  Mass Media Arts,"An introduction to the arts of the mass media with emphasis on how film, radio, television, and the print media influence and reflect society. INART 010 The Popular Arts in America: Mass Media Arts (3) (GA)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.  examines the historical and technological development of media in relationship to popular culture from the invention of the printing press up to present 21st century America. The primary goal of the course is to help students develop a critical and analytical approach to dealing with contemporary mass media. The course presupposes some familiarity with modern popular media and takes as its content both historical and contemporary examples as sources for analysis. While the class offers facts and data, the central focus of the course is the theory, stylistic elements, and structural workings of media content. The pedagogical goal of this approach is to examine not just what the mass media arts are but also where they come from, how they function, and what effects they have on our culture and society. The key to this goal is understanding the naturalized ideologies imbedded in the structural form of popular culture: how the early expressions of popular culture both shaped cultural attitudes and reflected societal notions of race, gender, and socioeconomic norms. Class meetings consist of lectures and in-class discussions that illustrate modern critical approaches to popular culture and the terminology used in presenting critical arguments and ideological viewpoints on these art forms. Reading assignments will support classroom work by presenting students with a diversity of opinion on popular culture and significant examples of that culture in media. Further, examples of historically significant popular mass media arts will be shown in class or online and then discussed in relation to the concepts and critical viewpoints covered in lectures."

INART 205: Introducing the Beatles,"The influence and achievement of the Beatles as artists focusing on their recordings and films as sociocultural artifacts.   Introducing the Beatles (3) (GA) is composed of eight unites of study that trace the lives and work of the Beatles. The course's chronological design is arranged in order to capture the band's artistic trajectory from two-track recording and the relatively primitive Please Please Me album through the sonic heights of Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The White Album, and Abbey Road. This course examines the group's wide-ranging sociocultural influence in terms of music, fashion, film, gender, consumerism, and politics. The thrust of the course is interpretive in nature, with the Beatles' songs and albums receiving considerable scrutiny in terms of their composition, production, and attendant musicianship. Developments in recordings and instrument technology are germane to our understanding of the Beatles' evolving aesthetic, as is the bandmates' development as songwriters who eventually eschew issues associated with romance in order to address larger and more prescient subjects such as loneliness, oppression, nostalgia, ethics, and redemption in their music. Each unit of study will be accompanied by the analysis of key examples from the Beatles' massive recorded corpus. More than 100 songs will receive consideration, as will the group's five forays as feature-film stars. Grades in  will be determined by two objective examinations- a midterm and a final. Class participation will be a key ingredient in student performance, as will students' work on two papers. The first of such assignments will involve a shorter paper in which students address a particular aspect of the band's sociocultural emergence during their early years. The longer term paper will be researched, argumentative essay in which students will be assigned to discuss any aspect of the Beatles' career - a particular album (or series of albums), their musical influence, or their cultural impact, among other topics - and construct a mature, expansive thesis about its meaning."
INART 220: Stand-Up Comedy: A Cultural History,"An American cultural history from mid-19th through mid-20th Century as seen through the prism of stand-up comedy.

INART 50: The Science of Music,"Waves, physics of sound, hearing, musical scales, musical instruments, and room acoustics. INART 050 The Science of Music (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course explores the physical and acoustical bases of sound and music.The physics include a study of vibrating systems and simple harmonic motion, wave propagation, reflection and refraction, superposition, resonant frequencies, harmonics, phase, the relationship of speed and velocity, and spectra. The acoustics portion applies these physical properties to hearing, sound and music, covering the nature of the human auditory system, and correlations of pitch to frequency, loudness to amplitude/power/intensity, timbre to spectra and envelope. An overview of perceptual psychological studies of Gestalt organizational principles and auditory streaming explores how the auditory system organizes sound on a primitive, unlearned level. NOTE: there need be no specific math prerequisite for the course. Though high school algebra and trigonometry will be recommended, these topics will be integrated with the rest of the course material.With physical and physiological groundwork laid, the subject matter movea to purely musical areas: the construction of musical scales, the nature of consonance, dissonance, and harmony. Twelve-tone equal temperament, the basis of Western common practice music, is not an absolute, but a decision made to facilitate certain musical choices, and a compromise in terms of optimal consonance. The nature of the different instruments is then discussed - strings, winds, brass, percussion, and voice. Different instruments naturally produce different scale types and different types of spectra. Students will learn to appreciate the inherent differences in different instrument types.The course then returns to acoustics, exploring the role that performance spaces play in the propagation and reception of sound. The shape and materials of a room determine its characteristic sound. Students learn about how sound in large auditoriums is characterized by the balance of direct and reflected sound, the distinction between specular and diffuse reflections, the absorptive properties of different building materials, and the nature of reverberation. Smaller performance spaces are subject to standing waves, flutter echo, and comb filtering. Taking steps to avoid undesirable characteristics is often an easy matter once the nature of these characteristics is understood. The final weeks cover audio technology and the distinctions between analog and digital formats."

JST 110: Introduction to the Bible: Old Testament,"The Old Testament (or, Hebrew Bible) is the record of the interaction between the people of ancient Israel and their God. As a religious text, the Bible is inextricably intertwined with the cultures of Israel's neighbors, including the Canaanites, Syrians, Greeks, Assyrians, Babylonians, Arabs, Egyptians, and the peoples of the eastern desert. To study the Hebrew Bible and its development during the first millennium BCE is to study the history, culture, and literature of the entire region. This course introduces students to the literature of ancient Israel, its rituals, the stories which established a people's identity, and which defined their moral behavior. Great figures of the texts, such as Moses, David, Solomon, Bathsheba, Ruth, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezra, teach us important lessons about life and how people of faith attempted to relate to one another, to God, and to people outside their ethnic group. Students will read from the biblical text, as well as from secondary source readings which contains scholarly opinion from a variety of sources. Recent archaeological and epigraphical studies will be incorporated into the course to enhance our work. The ultimate goal will be to assess the meaning of the texts in their ancient Near Eastern environment; to understand the development of Hebrew religion and the beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism; and to understand the connection between biblical studies and other fields of study, such as History, Religious Studies, Archeology, Linguistics, and Comparative Literature."

JST 160: Sacrifice in the Ancient World,"Sacrifice (from Latin sacer ""holy + facere ""to make"") is one of the most prevalent yet troubling aspects of religion. Its destruction and violence is often at odds with other rituals and core understandings within a religion, so why is it done and what good does it do? For the sacrificer, does it represent a gift to the gods, a renunciation, an exchange, a surrogate, or something else? This course will examine some competing definitions and theories of sacrifice, as well as its manifestations in the cultures and religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, especially those of Greece, Rome, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Hatti, Israel, and Phoenicia.

JST 439: Women and the Holocaust,"Analysis of women's experience in the Holocaust and exploration of the role of gender in Holocaust Studies.  J ST (HIST/WMNST) 439 Women and the Holocaust (3) Most of the early study of the Holocaust focused almost exclusively on the experiences of Jewish men. It was men who wrote the first and most widely read Holocaust memoirs and men who produced the first studies of the Holocaust. The first question motivating this class is thus what we can learn from examining women's experiences. Is it possible that the ghetto, the camp, and the forest look different from women's perspectives? Are there factors we miss when we read primary documents written by only half of the participants in these historical events? Beyond this, however, our exploration will also lead us to look more broadly at gender as a category of analysis. What do we gain by bringing questions of gender to bear on our study of the Holocaust? Are there any ethical concerns that should inform our approach?"
JST 443: Jewish Histories of the Middle East,"Jews have been part of Middle Eastern societies for thousands of years.

LA 101: Honors Rhetoric and Civic Life,"Within a liberal arts framework and with attention to public discourse-- speaking, writing, online communication, and visual presentation--this course instructs students in the arts, practices, and principles of rhetoric.  L A 101H Honors Rhetoric and Civic Life (4) (GWS)This course offers students comprehensive training in oral, written, visual, and digital communication for the twenty-first century. It unites these various modes under the flexible art of rhetoric and uses the pedagogies associated with the rhetorical tradition both to strengthen communication skills and to sharpen critical awareness of the challenges and advantages presented by oral, written, visual, and digital modes. Students will read about and discuss rhetorical concepts and situations and put their knowledge immediately to use by analyzing civic rhetoric on campus and in their communities (including their networked communities), by researching current issues, and by developing and presenting arguments in oral, written, visual, and digital form. The course is designed (although not required) for first-year Schreyer Honors College students and Paterno Fellows aspirants in the College of the Liberal Arts. In other words, it appeals to students with well developed communication abilities who might otherwise take English 30 and/or CAS 100H. It is aimed at developing students' skills in composing and delivering purposeful and effective texts. Whether or not those discourses are delivered verbally or visually (on paper, electronically, or orally), students will draw on established rhetorical canons of invention, arrangement, style, memory (tapping the resources of stored knowledge, such as the library), and delivery. Students will also become fluent in the rhetorical appeals of ethos, logos, and pathos in order to shape texts that are ethical yet purposeful. To meet these goals, students will meet in small classes (of no more than twenty students), where they will receive guided instruction in writing, public speaking, and the use of technology in order to learn the distinctive features of oral, written, visual, and electronic rhetoric. Staff for the course will be experienced full time faculty and advanced doctoral candidates in rhetoric drawn from English and CAS. This course will satisfy the Gen Ed Writing/Speaking (GWS) requirement for Schreyer Honors College students and aspiring Paterno Liberal Arts Fellows. Because this four-credit course will substitute for the six-credit ENGL 015/030 plus  requirement, students who complete  will need to take an additional two credits somewhere in order to complete graduation requirements."

LHR 201: Employment Relationship: Law and Policy,"surveys U.S. employment law. It begins with an overview of general legal concepts necessary to understanding the US legal system. It next examines the employment relationship and the employment contract, cornerstones in the field of employment law. In the main body of the course, students examine major state and federal labor and employment statutes, regulations, and cases that create employer and employee rights and obligations beyond those the parties have negotiated for themselves. This part of the course covers such topics as anti-discrimination law, wage and hour regulation, benefit and leave requirements, safety and health enforcement, workers' compensation systems, and the growing use of employer-mandated arbitration of statutory employment rights. Overall, the course analyzes workplace law problems from the different policy perspectives of employees, unions, employers, and the public. As appropriate, it introduces students to the economic, political, and social forces (both historical and contemporary) that influence the content of workplace law."
LHR 305: Human Resources Fundamentals,"This course will provide students with an opportunity to understand and apply important concepts concerning human resources in the workplace. Students will learn to think of the issues in the class from both the employees' and organizations' perspectives. The course begins with a description and analysis of the role human resource managers play in supporting employees' personal needs as well as an organization's strategic objectives. The discussion traces the changes in that role historically, as well as the  contemporary understanding of HR's part in helping stakeholders succeed. Against this backdrop, students will study three critical variables affecting HR's involvement in management: the individual; the organization; and, the law. Each of these foci illustrates variables with which HR managers must contend. The course presents these variables through a variety of lenses: law, psychology, sociology, history and literature. Students will also spend considerable time studying the various functions HR plays in recruiting, selecting, training, evaluation, compensation, labor relations and safety. In these portions of the class, students will learn to understand the functions not only from the organization's, but also from the employees' perspective. The discussion of functional areas will end with application of the concepts studied to the global business environment in which HR increasingly operates. Throughout students will not only learn the mechanics of, for example, the selection process, but how processes support an organization's and individual's pursuit of their unique purposes. Consistent with the liberal arts environment in which LHR students enroll, the final project requires students to apply the concepts learned concerning the HR function to their everyday lives, helping students to reflect on the difference HR processes can have on both the organization but equally important on the employee. As a Gen Ed course (GS), the course qualifies as a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) course consistent with the B.A. Fields category."
LHR 400: Comparative Employment Relations Systems,"Analysis of structure and elements of employment relations systems in developed and developing areas.  Comparative Employment Relations Systems (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course explores contemporary topics in employment relations in the world. The course examines seven examples of employment relations systems, each carefully chosen to illustrate important variations in employment relations practices. It also provides an overview of economic globalization and its impact on employment relations. Topics include global sweatshops, child labor, the diffusion of human resource practices, and corporate social responsibility. The first country case is Germany, which provides an example of a country with strong national unions and a highly developed system of works councils. The Swedish case exemplifies a long-tradition of centralized bargaining and tripartite relations that is now in transition. The third case, Japan, illustrates some of the initial experiences with team work, just-in-time production, and employee commitment through job security and training. China offers an example of a socialist system in transition that has become an economic powerhouse through massive export processing zones, government controlled unions, and wage competition. Brazil provides an important example of a Latin American country with a state dominated employee relations system. South Africa offers a case of highly politicized employment relations in a country in transition from extreme racial segregation to a democracy. Finally, India represents Asia's other economic powerhouse, with an English speaking workforce that is drawn to the booming call center industry and export-oriented production. The second half of the course looks at broader themes related to the topic of globalization. Sweatshops in Mexico and child labor in India examined alongside the diffusion of high-end human resource practices in Brazil. In this section, student will also study inter-governmental institutions such as the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. The final unit of this section examines the topic of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), recent attempts by corporations -at times in coordination with labor unions-to establish basic sets of rules or standards for their employees wherever units of the corporation might be located in the world today."

"LLED 227: Understanding Childhood through Children¿s Literature: Books, Media, Toys","This course is transdisciplinary in nature, looking at the multiple ways children's cultures are constructed in contemporary and canonical literature for children, transmitted through films, games, and toys. It blends approaches that consider art, history, politics, popular culture, and technology, as bases of inquiry into children's cultures and childhood. It also considers other classic and contemporary texts for young people. The course opens with students' initial understanding of childhood in their unique cultural spaces and settings. It then proceeds to discuss the dominant perceptions of childhood and their possible implications for how society considers the roles of children and their cultures. It recommends critical multiculturalism as a possible theoretical lens to examine how creators of children's texts construct and imagine children, children's cultures and/or childhood. The course also offers a brief history of children¿s literature. The last half of the semester explores other texts side-by-side children's books from various cultures to enable students to ponder myriad childhood and children's cultures under exploration in the different texts. What patterns do they notice? How might this enable them to further understand the complex nature of children's cultures? Course assignments include designing an artifact that is representative of an aspect of children's culture from course materials."
LLED 400: Teaching Reading in the Elementary School,"Introduction to the reading program; acquaintance with materials and techniques; observations of reading instruction; correlation with human growth and development.  Teaching Reading in the Elementary School (3)  is intended to help teacher candidates become knowledgeable users of theory and about language, literacy and culture; and to think through instructional problems thoroughly, using multiple sources of information to experiment with alternative solutions. Dealing specifically with reading, we recognize that text goes beyond print texts to include multimodal visual, auditory, digital, movement, and artifactual texts. In , candidates learn to understand how children develop as readers and users of literacies in and out of school. Candidates learn how to teach in ways that support children's successful development and uses of multiple kinds of literacy, including reading. Literacy teaching is both an intellectual and practical matter in which teachers work with students in ways that recognize the complexities of language and its social uses, learning and its cultural contexts, and schooling as organizational phenomena. Children enter schools with multiple types of literacy knowledge and cultural experiences. Coming to understand these complexities requires the coordination of both theoretical awareness and applied knowledge. Candidates' practice is developed as they learn to address the puzzles children present as they construct their knowledge of language, literacy, and literature in various social situations. Developing practical strategies to teach literacy requires a dedication of head, hand, and heart to treat all people with dignity, acknowledging the contributions of all cultural groups and respecting diversity as it honors ideals of social justice. In , teacher candidates develop a repertoire of organizational, instructional, and evaluative strategies that are based on research and best professional practices. Candidates work on projects independently and in collaborative groups. Content is presented by the instructor through a combination of lectures, weekly readings and reflections on readings, class discussion, activities and demonstrations, and viewing and analyzing video. Projects include an analysis of children as readers and curriculum planning. A field experience connected to  and  affords teacher candidates the opportunity to inquire about children's encounters with literacy in elementary grade classrooms.  is part of a block of courses in a PSU teacher education program that is unified by the basic set of principles supporting the development of a broader and more inclusive understanding of texts, children, and communities."
LLED 462: The Art of the Picturebook,"The Art of the Picturebook explores a wide range of picturebooks with the idea that illustrations are visual art evoking thoughts and feelings. Because picturebooks provide aesthetic experiences and contribute to aesthetic development, they are rich and important sources for literacy education. This course provides opportunities to extend students' repertoire of strategies for making sense of picturebooks, to deepen knowledge about picturebooks and the artists who create them, and to consider ways to help children become more sophisticated readers of picturebooks. While picturebooks are often emphasized as integral to the literacy development of young children, they can be engaging and desirable for older children as well. Course topics include picturebooks for the very young, as well as picturebooks that could appeal to elementary and middle school children. Whether picturebooks appear relatively simple and straightforward or contain innovatively complex or metafictive design elements, close readings of them with an understanding of terminology offer opportunities to express and discuss reactions and interpretations. The Art of the Picturebook provides students a forum for exploring preferences, ideas, insights, and questions about selected picturebooks, along with curricular and pedagogical considerations. Course readings include interviews with illustrators, selections about creating picture compositions, and scholarly essays presenting theoretical perspectives and ideas about picturebooks as literature and art for children's literacy development. This course emphasizes that reading and interpreting picturebooks is an active, creative process that is socially, culturally, and historically situated. Authors and illustrators are influenced by culture, so their art reflects values of that culture, consciously or unconsciously. A reader's experience with a picturebook is also influenced by cultural and social contexts in a given moment. Because engaging in aesthetic experiences is an active, creative process, reading picturebooks is, as Jane Doonan (1993), author of Looking at Pictures in Picture Books, asserts, a form of play. The Art of the Picturebook approaches picturebooks as sources of deep play. The course also provides opportunities to research selected illustrators, both for class discussions and an illustrator study project (e.g., a Wiki page). The culminating illustrator study project involves an in-depth investigation of a key children's book illustrator and a process of sharing works-in-progress with classmates for collaborative editing."
LLED 464: Nonfiction Literature for Children and Adolescents,"Nonfiction Literature for Children and Adolescents explores a wide range of nonfiction literature in a variety of subject areas including social studies, math, science, and the arts. This course takes the position that reading nonfiction literature can inspire curiosity and a life-long love of learning, shape inquiry, nourish empathy and compassion, and inform agency. Topics include nonfiction as literature, resources for locating nonfiction literature, nonfiction literature in different subject areas, nonfiction literature as a catalyst for inquiry, creative nonfiction and hybrid texts, biographies and autobiographies, and nonfiction literature for agency. This course also examines techniques of writing nonfiction literature to develop an understanding of strategies that published authors use to create engaging works to inform readers and provide pleasurable reading experiences. This understanding can help adults who work with children and adolescents recognize and identify the qualities that they find desirable for selecting and sharing nonfiction literature with children and youths, whether shared for reading or serving specifically as mentor texts for writing."
LLED 465: Fantasy Literature for Children,"Fantasy Literature for Children explores a range of fantasy literature including literary fairy tales, toy fantasies, ghosts/horror/suspense, science fiction, reworked fairy tales, low fantasy, and high fantasy. This course will consider different rationalizations for fantasy literature and will examine some of the key stories that illustrate fantasy from different perspectives, such as literary, social, and psychological angles. This course will look at, first, the beginnings of modern fantasy with the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and Carlo Collodi's classic, Pinocchio. Then the course reading will include ghosts and other supernatural fantasy stories, and ""reworked"" fairy tales, a current trend in fantasy literature. Despite of some scholarly debates on science fiction, that is, whether it should be categorized into fantasy or not, this course will consider science fiction as being similar enough to fantasy for it to be included. The course will also include a study of fantasy books currently popular with school-age readers. Fantasy can be divided into two main groups: low fantasy and high fantasy. Several of the stories to be read in the course are perhaps best categorized as low fantasies, not because of what they are, but because they are not high fantasy, which has a mythic quality to it. High fantasy seems to go beyond the particulars of its story to explore the nature of good and of evil. Though high fantasies can be humorous at times, the overall tone is serious. Often characters are on quests and the stakes of success or failure usually involve saving the world from some great evil or preventing the tyranny of some powerful and evil ruler. Reading the different types of fantasy literature and the literary critiques and analyses of those works, this course will be wrestling with the overall importance of those books in the lives of children by pondering imagination and its role in the lives of children."

MATH 403H: Honors Classical Analysis I,"Development of a thorough understanding and technical mastery of foundations of classical analysis in the framework of metric spaces.   Honors Classical Analysis I (3)The central aim of this course is to develop thorough understanding and technical mastery of foundations of classical analysis in the framework of metric spaces rather than multidimensional Euclidean spaces. This level of abstraction is essential since it is in the background of functional analysis, a fundamental tool for modern mathematics and physics. Another motivation for studying analysis in this wider context is that many general results about functions of one or several real variables are more easily grasped at this more abstract level, and, besides, the same methods and techniques are applicable to a wider class of problems, e.g. to the study of function spaces. This approach also brings to high relief some of the fundamental connections between analysis on one hand and (higher) algebra and geometry on the other. This course is a sequel to Math 312H; it is highly recommended to all mathematics, physics and natural sciences majors who are graduate school bound, and is a great opportunity for all Schreyer Scholars. The following topics will be covered: Metric spaces (topology, convergence, Cauchy sequences and completeness); Maps between metric spaces (continuous maps and homeomorphisms, stronger continuity properties:uniform continuity, Hoelder and Lipschitz continuity, contraction mapping principle, points of discontinuity and the Baire Category Theorem); Compact metric spaces (continuity and compactness, connectedness, total boundedness, coverings and Lebesgue number, perfect metric spaces, characterization of Cantor sets, fractals); Function spaces (spaces of continuous maps, uniform continuity and equicontinuity,Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, uniform approximation by polynomials.

Introduction to Weather Forecasting (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Never before has the quantity of available weather information so far exceeded the quality of the public's understanding of atmospheric science.

Students who successfully complete Meteorology 101 will be able to apply knowledge of fundamental concepts of atmospheric science to discriminate between reliable and unreliable weather forecasts, and to explain what makes one forecast better than another.To ensure that students develop the knowledge and skills required to critically assess public weather forecasts, Meteorology 101 will provide an apprentice-training environment that will encourage students to learn forecast mid-latitude weather themselves. They will discover that weather forecasting involves sophisticated data analysis techniques, a thorough understanding of atmospheric science, and strong verbal and graphic communication skills.

METEO 361: Fundamentals of Mesoscale Weather Forecasting,"Applying atmospheric principles to small-scale weather systems, with an emphasis on the conceptual modeling and short-range prediction of severe thunderstorms.   Fundamentals of Mesoscale Weather Forecasting (3) When outbreaks of severe weather occur, dire warnings for tornadoes, large hail or damaging straight-line winds urgently scroll across the bottoms of television screens. Simultaneously, television weathercasters warn viewers to ""take cover immediately"". Yet, because of the limited spatial and time scales of severe thunderstorms, the areas affected by tornadoes, large hail and damaging straight-line winds often turns out to be relatively small (sometimes as small a tenth of one percent of the original ""watch area""). There is no doubt that people should be prepared to take definitive action to protect their lives and the lives of their families when outbreaks of severe weather occur. But the overall impression that entire counties or cities will be destroyed by severe weather can be, and frequently is, misleading. One of the primary goals of : Fundamentals of Mesoscale Weather Forecasting is to give students a scientifically grounded perspective of the spatial and time scales of typical outbreaks of severe weather. In the process, students will become better weather consumers. To gain such insights, students will learn conceptual models of the life cycles of severe thunderstorms and will then apply them in real-time outbreaks of severe weather. In the final analysis, students will be able to more accurately weigh the information being disseminated by the media and the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.To ensure that students develop the knowledge and skills required to critically assess public weather forecasts,  will provide, like , an apprentice-training environment that will guide students, under the tutelage of professional weather forecasters, to actively learn how to create their own mesoscale-weather forecasts. In the process,  will reinforce the notion that weather forecasting involves sophisticated techniques of data analysis and a thorough understanding of atmospheric science.  will also stress that the clear communication of the forecast requires strong verbal and graphic communication skills.Using conceptual models and real-time radar and satellite imagery in concert with output from numerical models designed specifically for mesoscale forecasting, students will predict severe weather on time scales of a few hours to one day. For example, students will be given a litany of web-based tools and asked to place their own ""watch box"" for severe weather. Students will then be asked to verify and discuss the outcomes of their forecasts. For more general outlooks of severe weather (time scales of one to two days), students will use output from the numerical models that were introduced in  to identify the areas likely to be at risk for severe weather. It should be noted here that  will be one of four courses required for students to earn a Certificate of Achievement in Weather Forecasting, a unique online program offered through Penn State's World Campus. The three other courses that will comprise this online program are : Understanding Weather Forecasting, : Fundamentals of Tropical Forecasting and : Advanced Topics in Weather Forecasting.To facilitate the learning objectives,  will include the use of digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to on-line resources for weather data, text, and interactive quizzes that provide timely feedback.To demonstrate their mastery of the learning objectives, students will complete automated online quizzes, actively engage in online discussion groups focusing on real-time weather, and publish, to a personal 'e-portfolio', four comprehensive projects that will explore timely case studies related to weather forecasting. The e-portfolio will take the form of a Web site that students initially create during the second course of the program ( or ). Students will augment their e-portfolio as part of the requirements for ,  and . They will also use the space to reflect on their learning.At the end of the program, students will make a final e-portfolio entry that highlights their program accomplishments. In this way, the c-portfolio will serve both as a showcase of a student's work for the purpose of course assessment and as a chronicle of a student's achievements during the program.

They will learn how this scientific understanding has served as the foundation of a global system of weather observation and forecasting, encompassing a worldwide network of atmospheric observing instruments, powerful computer modeling systems, and a highly elaborate system for disseminating information to diverse users. Demand for weather forecasts is driven by the need to manage weather risks confronting agriculture, transportation, the military, insurance, humanitarian relief, and virtually every other sector of society. Examples will be given of how forecasts are incorporated into the decision-making of businesses. This topic leads to a discussion of the economic value of weather information, and the role of public and private providers of information.The treatment is organized around three themes. First, the possibility of generating a forecast of future conditions requires the adoption of the perspective that the natural world has an underlying regularity, and that this regularity can be discovered and organized through research. The second theme is the critical role of instrumentationin providing the quantitative basis for formal scientific forecasting models. Third, developments in weather forecasting have not proceeded solely from improvements in scientific knowledge: rather, society's demand for risk management toolshas acted as a constant spur on efforts to improve forecasting techniques, as part of a feedback loop between the producers and consumers of forecasts."

PHIL 102: Existentialism,"This course introduces students to the evolution of Existentialism, with its kernel in mid-nineteenth century reflection on Christianity's loosening grip on culture, its influence by the early-twentieth century experience of war's utter and widespread destructiveness, and its development in mid-twentieth century industrial and capitalist modernity. It concerns especially what it means to define one¿s own life in light of social pressures, interpersonal conflict, and economic forces, with or without the aid of traditional or religious guidance. This that means the course focuses on metaphysical, moral, and social issues concerning reality, the nature of the self, the basis of values, and the relations between individuality and community, and studies philosophical treatises, imaginative literature, and other genres of writing. Representative authors include Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Marcel, Wright, Ellison, Jaspers, Fanon, Camus, Beauvoir, Sartre, and Lorraine Hansberry."
PHIL 105: Philosophy of Law,"This course surveys philosophical questions concerning any legal system. What counts as a law? Do judges interpret or create new law? How can laws be unfair? What kinds of punishment, if any, are appropriate? When is civil disobedience justified? Could there be international law, and how can rights be enforced? These questions will often be asked in the context of the American system of common law and statutes, and thus will overlap with questions of federalism, constitutionalism, democracy, the police and prison systems, and social and economic structures. They will also require investigating the views of human nature underlying various philosophical positions. In general, the course examines the relations between human values, ethics, and law and the way these relations affect the organization of broader social, political, and religious institutions."
PHIL 109: Aesthetics,"Aesthetics is the philosophical study of our experience of certain natural and artistic objects that incite pleasure or displeasure in us, and which we judge to be beautiful, ugly, or sublime. Aesthetics asks: What makes something beautiful? Are our judgments of beauty universal? What counts as art? What are the relations between beauty, morality, and truth? The objective of this course will be to provide students with a survey of historical and contemporary perspectives on these questions. The students should leave the course with a good grounding in aesthetic theory as well as an understanding of how the theoretical considerations apply in art criticism."
PHIL 10: Critical Thinking,"This course provides a critical awareness of the function, nature, strengths, and weaknesses of argumentation in its various real-world and academic forms and contexts. Students examine the construction of persuasive arguments, discover types of fallacy, and learn how to evaluate reasoning for validity and soundness (that is, logicality and truth)."
PHIL 115: Philosophy and Education,"This course surveys the core philosophical questions that arise when thinking about education and teaching: What ought people to learn? How are instruction and experience related? What counts as knowledge and truth? How do we discover the human nature that underlies our educational theories? What are the moral implications of leading young people out of innocence or ignorance? What is there to education beyond classrooms, schooling, and reading? How much education ought a society to require or expect of its population? How important is intellectual and moral maturity? The course also considers the historical contexts from which philosophical theories about education have arisen and their ideological, political, social, and economic implications."
PHIL 11: Science and Truth,"This course investigates the nature of science, scientific reasoning, and the ""scientific method."" The value of objectivity and explanation will be considered in relation to our knowledge of the world and ourselves. Students will compare scientific truth claims to others, such as those from common sense, religion, the humanities, and pseudo-science. Key concepts include hypothesis, falsification, evidence, models, and theory. We ask: How do facts relate to proofs? What is the role of subjectivity in interpreting data? Does science progress? Are there questions science cannot answer? The goal of the course is for students to understand better the meaning, value, and limitations of the scientific enterprise."
PHIL 126W: Metaphysics,"This WAC course considers key concepts, problems, and figures in metaphysics, the investigation into the nature of reality. We will ask the deepest questions about what exists and how things relate to one another on a fundamental level. For example: Does everything ultimately reduce to simple substances, or is reality organized into types? Does time exist objectively, or is it dependent on the mind? Does effect follow cause as a matter of universal law or only as a statistical probability? What factors determine whether a thing is the same over time or differs at every instance? We will also query the most basic assumptions about reality, that a pencil will not fall through a desktop, the sun will rise tomorrow, and the world was not created a minute ago. Students will develop skills in reading difficult texts, evaluating arguments, and formulating their own philosophical views through discussion and in writing."
PHIL 12: Symbolic Logic,"This course is an introduction to symbolic logic. Logic is the science of correct reasoning, and symbolic logic is a particular branch of logic that studies correct reasoning using a formal or arti¿cial language. In this course, students will first learn basic vocabulary for argument analysis, standards for evaluating arguments that are expressed in English, and basic methods for testing these arguments along with the shortcomings of said methods. The deficiencies of the more natural approach to evaluating and testing arguments motivates a turn to learning symbolic logic as it purports to provide a more precise way of evaluating arguments. To this end, students will learn the symbols, syntax, and semantics of two different logical (formal, symbolic) languages (propositional and first-order predicate logic) and how to translate sentences from English into these formal languages. Once the languages are formulated, students will learn how to make use of mechanical tests (truth tables and/or truth trees) that allow for evaluating arguments for validity as well as testing propositions and sets of propositions for other logical properties (e.g. consistency, tautology, etc.). In addition to mechanical tests, students will learn how to solve proofs in two different languages. That is, they will learn a set of inference, derivation, or ""proof"" rules and use these rules to show that a conclusion follows from a set of premises."
PHIL 198: Special topics,"Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest."
PHIL 201: Medieval Philosophy,"This course examines key themes developed by the philosophers from the long millennium between the fall of Rome and the rise of the Renaissance, many of whom responded to ancient Greek philosophy in the context of their theological commitments (Christian, Jewish, Muslim). The works of Augustine and Aquinas are at the core; readings may also include works by Boethius, Anselm, Abelard, Occam, Scotus, Avicenna, Al-Kindi, Maimonides, and Averroes. We ask: What is the fundamental nature of reality, and where do humans fit in? How ought we to understand essence and existence? Do abstract concepts correspond to real ""universals"" or are they mere names? What does a belief in free will and evil commit us to? What should we make of the arguments for God¿s existence? What are laws of nature, and in what respect might natural law govern our lives? To answer these questions, we examine the cultural and Greek/Roman background of medieval philosophy, and give close study to the significant philosophical and related texts of the tradition."
PHIL 203: Nineteenth Century Philosophy,"The nineteenth century is a period of political upheaval and ongoing social, cultural, and scientific transformation, shaped in equal parts by the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. This transformative character is reflected by the epoch¿s most influential philosophers. Kant's ""critical"" philosophy emphasizes the primacy of practice and the subject's active role in constructing reality. Hegel focuses on the rationality implicit in the historical growth of religion and the political institutions of the state. As the century wears on, escalating social and political conflicts lend credibility to outspoken critics of such optimistic rationalism. Schopenhauer¿s pessimism, Kierkegaard's existentialist focus on the irrationality of faith, Marx's historical materialism and emphasis on class struggle, Nietzsche's ""genealogical"" anti-realism and philosophy of power are prominent examples. The embrace of new paradigms in morality (Mill), natural science (Bergson), and psychology (Freud, James) round out the picture of a century in transition from ""classical"" European modes of thought to the self-conscious secularism and dynamism of the 20th century. By reading a broad selection of representative texts, students will learn about the major figures and streams of thought that shaped the course of this eventful period in the history of Western philosophy."
PHIL 299: Foreign Studies,Courses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.
PHIL 402: Seminar in European Philosophy,"Among the most important movements to emerge in the decades around 1900 are phenomenology (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) and neoKantianism (Natorp, Cassirer), which make important contributions in metaphysics, epistemology, and to research in the foundations of logic, mathematics, and science. Hermeneutical thought (Dilthey), by contrast, emphasized ""historicity"" over the ostensibly timeless objects of traditional philosophical thought, insisting that interpretive ""understanding"" of historically situated subjectivity was a kind of knowledge distinct from the ""explanation"" of purely objective phenomena, while Marxism urged attention to historical development in the name of social critique and political change. These productive tensions are evident in the major movements that dominate mid-twentieth century Continental philosophy: existentialism (Heidegger, Sartre), critical theory (Adorno, Horkheimer), and structuralism (Jacobson, Lacan, Althusser). Beginning in the 1960s, French Continental philosophy enters a phase of self-criticism that gives rise to innovative and challenging forms of discourse, often referred to collectively as post-structuralism (Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze). These thinkers challenge basic assumptions of classical Continental philosophy, e.g., the centrality of subjectivity; the privileging of identity over difference; the non-violent sovereignty of reason; the unity, continuity, and progressive character of history; the possibility and desirability of totalizing ""structures"" of collective power, action, and intelligibility. At the same time, secondgeneration critical theorists (e.g., Habermas) seek to revise their teachers' overly rigid commitment to Marxism and outmoded psychological and sociological conceptions in favor of more nuanced theory of ""communicative action"" and the structural transformation of the public sphere. Building on its survey-oriented precursor (), this course provides an opportunity for more focused engagement with selected authors and works, or with particular topics or streams of thought pursued through attention to a variety of authors and works."
PHIL 407: Seminar in Philosophy of Technology,"The human condition may very well be a technological condition. Developing and refining technology have proven central to cultural and perhaps even evolutionary history, the development of science, our economic practices, and-most importantly-our selfunderstanding. Should we understand the co-development of humanity and technology as a continuous history? Or have the past two centuries-with the development of industrial mechanization, the computer, and now the Internet-marked a radical shift of some kind? This course will explore the philosophy of technology in more focused and rigorous ways than the department's lower-division course, , seeking to understand the way in which technology is transforming our relationships to ourselves, to other people, and to our world. Guiding questions for the course include: What is technology? How does it inform and inflect human flourishing and the human condition? What are its ramifications for ethical thought?"
PHIL 408W: Seminar in Social and Political Philosophy,"This course builds on lower level courses in social and political philosophy (e.g., 108) to provide an in-depth examination of philosophical issues relating to political institutions and social practices. These issues may include questions concerning the justification of government; the nature of equality, freedom, democracy and other modes of political organization; or issues concerning the evaluation of social life such as race and racism, cultural identity, power, and violence. Assigned readings willy typically include historical and contemporary philosophical work on these questions as well as material on current events, social controversies, historical material, and other works that expand and reflect upon these core issues."
PHIL 426W: Seminar in Metaphysics,"Examines the nature of reality, the existence of freedom, and the nature of matter, mind, and values."
PHIL 427: Seminar in Philosophy of Mind,"The nature of the mind and its relation to the physical world is the focus of this course, which builds on its precursor (). Topics include the definition of consciousness, what constitutes a self, and whether artificial constructions like robots could have minds. Views on these topics, as formulated by a range of (largely twentieth-century) movements - logical behaviorism, functionalism, (physicalist) reductionism, eliminativism, dualism, mind-brain identity theory, and enactivism - have significant metaphysical and ethical consequences. If consciousness is separate from the body, physical theories of causation cannot explain the effect of thought on action. If robots can have minds, there are reasons to be concerned about exploitation of robots as well as the possibility of robot domination. Students will investigate these topics in greater depth, typically either by selecting one or two for careful study or by focusing on the thought of one or two selected authors, e.g., Ryle, Smart, Millikan, Fodor, Block, Churchland, and Chalmers. Texts will challenge students to read and analyze contemporary and historical scholarly work on the topic. The issues discussed will encourage reflection on the assumptions students have about themselves and how their minds shape and are shaped by the world."
PHIL 433: Ethics in Science and Engineering,Ethical issues arising in the practice of science and engineering and their philosophical analysis.
PHIL 438: Seminar in Feminist Philosophy,"This course will explore some of the influential theories and texts in the field of feminist philosophy. Feminist philosophy encompasses a broad range of inquiry, from political and ethical issues to foundational metaphysical and epistemological problems - e.g., What is a woman? What is the relationship between knowledge, epistemology, and power? Feminist philosophical approaches are diverse and include thinkers from all approaches to philosophy and are often richly influenced by work in women of color feminisms (e.g., intersectionality, Latinx), approaches to sexuality studies (e.g., LBGT studies and Queer Theory), post- and decolonial studies, and disability studies. Assigned readings will typically offer a range of approaches to feminist philosophy. While a majority of the readings will cover issues discussed by contemporary thinkers, a few historically significant feminist philosophers will often be included. Through reading and discussion, this course will introduce students to some of the central approaches to feminism, some of the most pressing issues, as well as the central controversies of feminist philosophy. Students will develop their interpretative and philosophical skills, while gaining a deeper understanding of the importance of feminist philosophy to the tradition of philosophy as well as to the general betterment of society."

PHIL 490: Dewey,"Critically examines the metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic, aesthetics, education theory, and social and political philosophy of this major American pragmatist."
PHIL 4: The Human Condition,"This course introduces central philosophical questions about the lives we humans live: Can our lives have meaning, and does their value depend on it? Does each of us have a true self to be discovered, or a shared human nature we cannot escape? What do we mean by ""authenticity,"" is it worth striving for, and can it be achieved? What difference does recognizing your mortality make to anything? We explore these questions in conversation with influential historical perspectives and contemporary theories, while approaching them from everyday concerns. Doing so provides a path for introducing philosophical ideas and evaluations into ordinary life."
PHIL 8: Gender Matters,"Feminism is one approach to addressing systematic oppressions of both women and men. This course examines various feminist philosophical approaches to issues such the construction of gender, sex, and sexuality, the nature of gender injustice, and the intersectionality of oppressions. It also addresses contemporary issues, including sexual harassment and assault, abortion, explicit and implicit bias, and discrimination and exclusion."

Students are introduced to the central questions in comparative politics, including What is the state and where did it come from? What is democracy? Why are some countries democracies whereas others are dictatorships? Does the kind of regime a country has affect the prosperity and well-being of its citizens? Why are ethnic groups politicized in some countries but not in others? Why do some countries have many parties whereas some have only a few? How do governments form, and what determines the type of government that takes office? What are the material and normative implications associated with different types of government? The course examines competing answers to questions such as these and evaluates the explanations for their logical consistency and empirical accuracy. Students learn to compare political phenomena across disparate contexts and how to use such comparisons to test claims about the political world. In doing so, they learn about the similarities and differences among countries and a range of approaches to analyzing the political world."

In particular, it investigates what makes civil wars more likely to occur, what influences how long they last, how severe they are, and how likely they are to recur, while also considering their consequences for the states that experience them. It considers the scholarly research on this topic over the past decade or more, and builds an awareness both for what are the known regularities as well as what are the continuing uncertainties about the place of civil war in the contemporary international system. It does this specifically within the context of scientific research about civil wars, and thus also advances student knowledge about how social scientists learn what they know about how the world works. Building on this perspective, and after absorbing the lessons to be learned from the literature, students will gain even greater appreciation for the quality of knowledge about civil wars by conducting their own detailed analysis of a civil war (each student will study one civil war of their choosing) asking how well the civil war they study fits patterns identified by the literature. This course complements, without duplicating, existing political science courses about militarized political conflict, and qualifies as one course majors can take to satisfy their 400-level course hours requirement. In addition to political science majors, it should be of interest to international politics majors, students in other social science majors, and perhaps Masters students in the School of International Affairs as well."
PLSC 440: Globalization and Its Implications,This course explores the socioeconomic implications of globalization.
PLSC 445Y: Politics of Affirmative Action,"Examines history, politics, and economics of the use of special programs to advance racial interests in the U.S.  /  /  Politics of Affirmative Action (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The objectives of this course are to introduce students to the relationship between affirmative action and other policies purportedly designed to end racial inequality in the U.S. This course approaches the study of affirmative action in the context of the historic racial discrimination and inequality that Black Americans have faced since the founding of the Nation. The purpose of this course is to help students think about how contemporary and historic affirmative action policies relate to race, concepts racial inequality, the historic and continuing causes for racial inequality, public opinion, American politics and economic thought. The course materials will lead students through scholarly and popular articles, books and video presentations on the topic. It is hoped that students will become familiar with the history of affirmative action from its conception. Students will gain an intimate understanding of affirmative action economic and social outcomes on various racial groups. No prior knowledge is assumed, however a knowledge of civil rights history, quantitative methods, and constitutional law will be useful. The Politics of Affirmative Action satisfies the requirements for major and minor electives for the African American Studies, and major and minor electives for Political Science, and Labor Studies and Industrial Relations. Students are evaluated on the basis of an examination, term paper, class participation and class presentations of papers."

PLSC 454: Government and Politics of Africa,"Contemporary African politics, institutions, and ideologies; patterns of change, social forces, and nation building in selected African states.  /  Government and Politics of Africa (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. In this course, we will discuss the current democratization trend in Africa by focusing on the experiences of African countries.The course is divided into three sections. Part One considers a range of factors that affect politics in Africa. We will discuss in depth the following factors: colonialism, nationalism, the relationship between state and society, ruler-ship, the military, political parties, and economic development. Then, we will consider the experiences of our four cases, to gain a historical background. In part two, we will focus on democratic transitions. We will discuss the factors that enable transitions to occur, as well as the process that transitions follow. Then, we will consider four transitions: two that resulted in the installation of a democratic government (Nigeria in 1979, Sudan in 1986) and two that ended in continued authoritarianism (Angola in 1992, Kenya in 1978). Part three considers the prospects of democracy. We will discuss the probability of a democratic transition occurring in the near future.The goals of this class are four fold. First, students will gain detailed knowledge about four African countries. Second, we will learn how to compare countries. Third, students will have a better understanding of the democratization process in general, and will be able to explain or predict democratization beyond the four cases discussed in this class. Finally, the experiences of these four countries offer a deeper understanding of what democracy is and provide students with greater flexibility to fulfill requirements in either the African and African American Studies major or the Political Science/International Politics major.  /  will be offered once per year with 35-50 seats per offering."

PLSC 486: International Culture in East Asia,"Study of the role of culture in East Asian regional and East-West international relations.  (PL SC 486/HIST 489) International Culture in East Asia (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course will examine the place of culture in international history through a comparative look at the role of cultural circulation and exchange in relations among China, Korea, and Japan (and between East Asia and the West) from the propagation of Buddhism in the first century A.D. to present-day circulation of popular music, movies, and comics. We will explore the international politics of culture and the politics of international culture, considering questions of what constitutes culture, whether it is ever entirely separate from politics, and how that separation has evolved over time. These larger themes of the course will be tackled by following the historical movement of concrete objects and people throughout the region. This is a course in international history, but it also seeks to explore aspects of international relations. The goals of the class are not only to gain an understanding of the uses and impact of culture in international relations, but also to develop the skill of building such an understanding through primary and secondary sources, both written and visual. Students in this class will think critically about assigned texts to develop their own interpretations of their meanings. Through readings, discussions, presentations, and the final project, students will enhance their ability to think critically and to express their ideas clearly in both speech and writing. Class work includes some lecture but emphasizes guided discussions, group work, writing exercises, and some student presentations. This participatory approach is intended to deepen students' appreciation of the assigned readings, to help them understand value systems that may differ from those predominant in western cultures, and to assist students in developing both analytic and expressive abilities."
PLSC 488: Comparative Public Policy,"Comparative methodology and public policy implementation in postindustrial societies; selected case studies of policy output.  PL SC 488 Comparative Public Policy (3) Comparative Public Policy is an upper level political science course that includes components of comparative politics, public administration, and descriptive economics. The course presumes that developed industrial democracies confront common challenges in meeting human needs and that policy comparison is worthwhile despite distinctive societies and political cultures. For example, government involvement in the provision of health care varies widely from Britain's National Health Service to the largely private approach of the United States. Nevertheless all health care systems confront rising technology costs, an ageing population, and rising performance expectations. A primary purpose of the course is to consider the origin and development of individual country programs while assessing the common challenges. Cross national comparison becomes relevant to the course by including some available data on costs, implementation and outcomes. Because the course includes about six distinct areas, e.g., education, taxation, urban planning income support, and overall macroeconomic policy, the course will depict profiles of policymaking in Europe, North America and Japan. Ideally comparison should help students to evaluate the effectiveness of policy choices of a particular country and government. A second objective of the course will be to examine the national approaches to the relationship between the state and private economic activity. Not only does government expenditure amount to nearly half of some country's total output, government choices create distinctive legal environments for business activity. Antitrust, health, wage, and consumer regulation offer an excellent point of comparing different incentives for economic activity in the United States and Europe. Apart from policy choices mentioned in the first paragraph, the regulation of economic activity has cumulative results for employment and the distribution of income. This portion of the course is intended to be somewhat more elementary than the first because of the probability that students will be less familiar with its content. The primary objective will be to help students understand the variations among market economies and reasons for their description as ""neo-liberal,"" ""social market,"" or ""corporatist."" Finally, the course will examine some current ideas about recent changes in the global economy and their consequences for national policy. Clearly ""globalization"" has become a matter of political concern owing to its consequences for the creation of wealth, employment, growth and distribution. While the course cannot devote detailed or exclusive to the European Union, Europe's response to rapid movements in short term capital and investment presents an interesting point of comparison with the United States and Japan. The course should enable students to understand the meaning and criticism of ""globalization"" as a factor in shaping some national policies."
PLSC 490: Policy Making and Evaluation,"Advanced analysis of public policy, emphasizing policy evaluation and the factors that determine policy success and failure."
PLSC 495: Political Science Internship,"Combining experience in government offices, related agencies, or law firms, with appropriate readings and a research paper/report."

PLSC 60N: Society and Cultures in Modern Israel,"Israel is often portrayed in media and popular society in incomplete or distorted terms. In some cases, it is presented as a troubled, violent, dangerous place, as a place permeated by long-standing hatred between Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. In others, the focus is on the state's role as the center of Judsiam--a home of the ""chosen people"" and the source of inspiration for one of the world's great monotheistic religions. Some present it as a model for how a democracy can succeed under trying demographic, historic, and geopolitical circumstances. Others frame Israel as a place of conflagration (armageddon) that will usher in a messianic period or as a nation-state with a discriminatory regime that privileges its majority population over its minority and administers oppressive policies over Palestinians in the occupied territories it captured in the 1967 War. While there are elements of truth in each of these presentations, the full picture of Israeli society is much richer and more complex. This course teaches students to cut through the mythology, and develop a more accurate understanding of what Israel is in the 21st century. Since Israel is a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse society, it is only possible to understand the true nature of modern Israel through exploring the many sub-groups that comprise the Israeli citizenry. The course looks at Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews (both religious and secular), Muslim and Christian Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, Ethiopian-Israelis, Russian-Israelis, Bedouins, and Druze. For each group, it looks at demographics, background histories, migration patterns, institutions, cultural norms, values, and practices. We will look at what is important to each group, how they see and organize themselves, and how they understand and experience the world around them. The course aims to convey an understanding of the geographic, demographic, and social-historical context in which Israelis live as well as the diversity of Israeli culture. Students will be challenged to be critical readers of Israeli society and the way it is represented and to strive for measured, evidence-based analyses."
PNG 301: Introduction to Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering,"The first part of the course will introduce the student to the design and implementation of the systems used in the extraction of oil and gas, including terminology and basic calculations in drilling engineering, geology, production, reservoir, and facilities engineering. The course will give an initial overview of the history of the oil industry and the origins of petroleum and natural gas reservoirs, followed by a description of the conventional and unconventional reservoir types. All aspects of petroleum engineering from upstream to downstream will be included in this discussion, including transportation, marketing, and environmental impacts. The remainder of the course will present the various key disciplines in petroleum and natural gas engineering in the chronological order of how the disciplines interact. Key problems in each of these disciplines will be reviewed and solved, using Excel and introductory statistics/computer programming (using Matlab). First, the discipline of drilling engineering will be presented. This will focus on the different types of wells, bits, casing designs, and completion techniques. Topics in the discipline of reservoir engineering will be presented next and will include basic petrophysics, reservoir types and fluids, as well as basic extraction methods. The life cycle of a reservoir and its efficient and environmental friendly management will be discussed, including enhanced oil recovery methods, such as carbon dioxide injection and surfactant flooding. Topics in production engineering will be presented next, and will center on tubing design, artificial lift, stimulation using acids and fracturing, and cased-hole logging. Topics in facility engineering, the last discipline to be discussed, will focus on surface facilities such as separators, gas and water gathering systems, pipelines, stock tanks, chokes, and recycle plants. Finally, differences between unconventional and conventional extractions and systems will be described as this is now critical to the energy security of the United States. Focus here will be on shale properties, fluid property changes owing to tiny pores, diffusion, absorption, and hydraulic fracturing. The course will explain how fracturing in shale reservoirs differs from conventional ones. Transport of oil or gas from these tight rock matrixes by diffusion through the fracture network will be presented. Environmental considerations will also be discussed."

PORT 200: Advanced Portuguese via the Arts,"This course provides a more detailed study of the Portuguese language that builds upon the grammar, vocabulary, and communicative abilities developed in the basic language sequence. Students will review and extend their abilities in all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) as they learn more about the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Portuguese-speaking world. The course uses a textbook paired with written, audio, and video workbook activities and supplemented by authentic language materials and artistic works that generate communicative exercises that allow students to practice and refine their spoken and written Portuguese. As students improve their understanding of the Portuguese language, they also gain insight into Luso-Afro-Brazilian cultures by analyzing music, films, videos, paintings, photos, essays, chronicles, news articles, short stories, and poems. Students learn about the distinct contexts in which Portuguese is spoken as they examine artistic works and linguistic variations that develop within specific countries and region.  This class serves as a transition course between basic and intermediate language classes and more advanced composition, literature, and culture courses taught at the 300 and 400-level. The class is conducted entirely in Portuguese. Students must have taken Portuguese 3 or 123, or received permission of the instructor, in order to enroll in this course."

PPEM 405: Microbe-Plant Interactions:  Plant Disease and Biological Control,"Survey of microbe-plant interactions causing plant disease, mechanisms of pathogenesis, disease management, and microbial and molecular biological control strategies.   Microbe-Plant Interactions: Plant Disease and Biological Control (3) Plant health in both natural and agricultural ecosystems is essential for sustaining human society and all other life forms on Earth. Plant disease epidemics are common and diverse and can have devastating effects on our population and economy by debilitating the ecosystems on which we depend. This course focuses on biological and environmental factors that influence microbe-plant interactions which in turn determine plant health and initiate plant disease epidemics. Developing strategies for maintaining healthy plants in both natural and agricultural ecosystems requires an understanding of pathogen and host biology, as well as the role of the environment in disease epidemiology. Students will learn about the survival and spread of important plant-infecting fungi, bacteria, phytoplasma, and viruses and how mechanisms for microbial pathogenicity are influenced by the environment. The final section of the course will focus on the use of beneficial microorganisms to maintain and improve plant health. Grades will be based on student performance on a wide variety of activities including labs, quizzes, seminar reports, and exams."

PPEM 417W: Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogenesis in Plants,"This course covers the mechanisms that certain bacteria use to infect and cause disease in plants. We will consider the molecular, genetic, biochemical, and physiological systems that are used by plant-pathogenic bacteria to move about and infect plants, cause disease symptoms, evade plant immune responses, and derive nutrition from the plant. We will cover these topics through a combination of lectures and close readings of current and classic primary research articles. The course also has a major, hands-on laboratory component that includes experiments on bacterial genetics related to disease, bacterial physiology and behavior, and the stimulation of plant immune responses during bacterial infection. Students taking this class can expect to gain experience reading primary plant bacteriology research literature and designing and implementing experiments in plant-bacterial interaction."
PPEM 430: Air Pollution Impacts to Terrestrial Ecosystems,"This course introduces student to air pollutant sources, transport, meteorology, and temporal and spatial trends of pollution dispersion and deposition. An overview is presented of the direct and indirect effects of air pollutants on terrestrial ecosystems with an emphasis on plant life. The effects of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, halogens, and combined pollutants leading to acidic atmospheric depositions are presented. Emphasis is placed on air pollutants as plant pathogens leading to symptoms and eventual long-term accumulative effects to entire ecosystems. Methods of diagnostics, factors affecting plant response, ecosystem decline and resiliency, pest interactions, assessment of loss and cost/benefit analysis leading to abatement follows. Final parts of the course include perspectives of public awareness, development of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, compliance prevention of significant deterioration, and the Clean Air Act reforms of 1990."
PPEM 456: Applied Microbial Ecology,"This is a lecture based course that will broaden students' understanding of the diverse biotic and abiotic interactions relevant to microbes in diverse environments. In particular, this course focuses on ecological interactions between microbes in a common environment or between microbes and their eukaryotic hosts (e.g. plants and animals). In addition to learning about ecological theory as it applies to microbes, students will learn about historical and contemporary approaches to studying microbes in different environments. This will include substantial focus on cutting edge '-omics', microscopic, and direct functional analytical approaches to understand both the distribution of microbial taxa (i.e. who's there) and what processes they carry out in their natural environments (i.e. what they're doing). In the latter portions of the class, students will apply the theory and techniques to understanding the ecology of specific environments, including environmental, agricultural, and food environments. The objectives of this course include: provide students with a firm understanding of contemporary microbial ecology and environmental microbiology; conceptually link processes that occur in disparate environments, such as plant roots, termite guts, and cheese rinds; provide students with the language to discuss these concepts and processes; make students familiar with and conversant in 'omic' and other cutting edge functional techniques used to study microbes in their natural environments; provide select examples of how humans take advantage of microbial ecology for our benefit (such as suppression of pathogens or promotion of waste decomposition). The course will conclude with a research and writing project where students will review the microbial ecology of a specific environment. This course expects students to have an understanding of basic microbiological concepts."

PSYCH 217N: The Science of Human Resilience,"This course provides a comprehensive understanding of resilience from both a biological and psychological perspective. It provides students with an integrative approach to understand the dynamic interplay between nature and nurture in understanding children's at-risk behaviors as well as understanding children's resilient behaviors. The study of resilience will be examined with a systems approach using a strengths-based framework of positive youth development. Topics will include brain development, the biology of stress, environmental factors influencing resilience, children's mental health, growth mindset, and the science of resiliency. Specific attention will be directed towards understanding the neuroplasticity of resilience. Content will be presented using interactive lectures, in-class activities, readings, and small group discussions. After taking this course, students will increase their understanding of how specific environmental factors interact with biological underpinnings to affect children's levels of resilient and at-risk behaviors (e.g., depression). Strategies to optimize children's positive developmental outcomes will be emphasized throughout. This course includes a service learning component where students have the opportunity to apply newly acquired skills to mentor children in supervised school/community settings."
PSYCH 244: Introduction to the Psychology of Human Factors Engineering,"Human Factors Psychology is an area of psychology where the overall focus is the scientific study of human behavior and how it can be applied to the use, design and development of products and systems, Students will learn basic principles of how people process information, perceive and interact with the world in various circumstances, They will learn how psychologists conduct research on human thought and behavior in an effort to measure peoples' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. These basic principles will be illustrated and explored with a series of hands-on activities that relate the material to everyday life. Topics to be covered include research design and methods, sensation and perception, memory and language, and social psychology. Psychological principles from these areas will be used to discuss ways to improve the safety of tools and systems, reduce human error and increase user satisfaction. Students will also gain a better understanding of the influence of stress and workload on human performance. A major topic will be ways to develop reliable and valid evaluation techniques for assessing performance, safety and ease of use of systems. In order to design effective systems, individual differences in age, gender and culture must be taken into account. People in different regions of the world have cultural differences that influence the way they perceive the world and process information. These individual differences will be addressed throughout the semester. Topics are presented through a combination of lectures, readings, demonstrations, and in-class activities. Active learning elements such as library/internet research, writing activities, and collaborate learning experiences will be applied. Evaluation is on the basis of content-based quizzes, objective exams, brief written reports of hands-on exercises, and collaborative assignments."
PSYCH 253: Introduction to Psychology of Perception,"The goal of this course is to give students a detailed introduction to the basic questions in the study of how the energies and information in the external world become part of our immediate experience. This includes questions about how patterned energies (such as light, sound, etc.) are coded by our sensory systems and how those codes are used to support psychological experience. These are fundamental and fascinating questions and concern the most basic ways in which we interact with and experience the physical world. Students will consider these questions in detail with respect to the visual and auditory systems, and time permitting, with other sensory systems. Because these questions are such fundamental questions, they have long intellectual histories. Philosophers and scientists have been working on these questions for centuries, and the scientific study of them forms the basis for much of contemporary scientific psychology. We will be examining some of this intellectual history and be discussing the connection between the scientific study of sensation and perception and the other natural sciences, including biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics (including computer science). The class will also focus on some of the tools and techniques that have been developed for the study of sensation and perception. The course will show that these tools and techniques are very general and have application to a broad range of issues in human psychology. Students will learn the basic procedures for data collection and analysis, and the procedures for evaluating inferences on the basis of that data. The study of perception requires the integration of techniques, methods, and tools from a variety of other sciences, including mathematics. Physics, algebra, and geometry are involved in understanding light as a source of information. Chemistry is involved in the absorption of light by photoreceptors as well as the mechanisms of neural communication in all sensory systems. Probability and electrical engineering contribute the tools used to conduct signal detection analyses of perceptual performance. It is not assumed that students are experts in any of these fields, nor do we expect that students will be when the course is complete, however, we do expect students to be willing to consider their importance to perceptual psychology."
PSYCH 260A: Neurological Bases of Human Behavior,"Biological Psychology is an area of psychology where the overall focus is the scientific study of behavior and experience, and underlying associated neurological and physiological processes. This course provides an overview of the biological bases of behavior and includes a presentation of the research, theory, and application of this knowledge. Specific topics include the basic anatomy and physiology of the central and peripheral nervous system, neural transmission and the function of various neurotransmitters. The majority of the course will focus on how these basic processes contribute to the processing of information from the senses, simple and complex learning, and cognitive processes such as memory, and language. Topics will include cover brain development, developmental and acquired neuropsychological disorders and therapeutic techniques. Content is presented through a combination of lectures, readings, demonstrations, and in-class activities. A major goal of the course is to show how questions relating brain and neural function to behavior are addressed through empirical research. The course introduces students to theories, research, and procedures used in psychological research and practice. It also promotes thinking about how students can apply this knowledge to enhance their lives. After taking this course students will be able to explain the relationship between brain and behavior. They will make more informed decisions about participating in future psychology courses and gain a better appreciation of the science and profession of psychology."
PSYCH 281: Introduction to Industrial-Organizational Psychology,"This course introduces the concepts and methods used to study people within and as they relate to the world of work.

PSYCH 426: Language and Thought,"Relations between language and cognition; cognitive implications of normal and impaired language development; cognition and bilingualism.  LING () 429 Language and Thought (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Is language a special and uniquely human ability that develops and functions independently of other cognitive processes? Do individuals who speak different languages also have different concepts about the meaning of objects and ideas? Does language development depend on exposure to spoken language? In this course we will examine the relation between language and thought by considering evidence on language and cognition in both children and adults.

RLST 120: New Testament,"/  /  New Testament (3) (GH)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course provides an introduction to the collection of early Christian writings that make up the New Testament. It begins with an examination of the first-century context in which these writings took shape-one overshadowed by the Roman empire, influenced by Hellenistic culture, and based, above all, on varieties of Judaism. From there, the course takes up a few guiding questions. How, in this ancient context, did the first Christians understand and portray the figure at the center of their communities, Jesus of Nazareth? What do the New Testament writings reveal about the beliefs and aspirations of these communities as they advanced a movement that would, in time, become among the most consequential in world history? By the end of the course, students will have gained knowledge of the historical context of New Testament writings and an understanding of why the New Testament has been such an important and influential collection of writings."
RLST 123: History of God: Origins of Monotheism,"This course examines the early history of God; that is, the concept of the divine as a single supreme being. In particular, it focuses on the origins of monotheism and the development of its three major traditions in the Near East: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, from their respective beginnings to around 1000 C.E. The course will begin with an analysis of the polytheistic religious milieu of the Ancient Near East in the second and first millennia B.C.E., and will consider the question of how, when, and why belief in one God first appeared in ancient Israel. Various modern theories about the origins of Israel's national God (Hebrew Yhwh/Yahweh and Aramaic Yhw/Yaho) will be analyzed, with careful attention to the evidence of ancient texts and archaeology. Following a discussion of the nature of the religion(s) of early Israel, the course will then turn to the development of Judaism as the world's first monotheism. It will then examine the subsequent emergence of Christianity in Roman-era Palestine and Islam in Late Antique Arabia, with a brief glance at the Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, which shares some commonalities. Finally, the course will compare and contrast some of the major beliefs, practices, and significant historical trends and movements within the first centuries of the three major monotheisms."
"RLST 137: Gender, Sexuality, and Religion","explores the history of different conceptions of gender and sexuality as they are understood within major religions (e.g. Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, indigenous spiritual systems). The course emphasizes modern and contemporary contexts of gender/religion debates, introducing feminist historical methods in order to trace the origins and trajectories of today's controversies. Students should expect to gain a comparative historical perspective on at least three theological traditions. Possible topics include: history of gender and religious practices; femininities and masculinities in a spiritual context; the flesh and the spiritual body; and sexuality, and both ethical and theological approaches to theories of gender, feminism, and identity. We will explore ways in which religious teachings, in both historical and contemporary contexts, inform secular understandings of gender and the ways in which contemporary conceptions of gender inform religious practice. While religion plays a crucial role in defining sex and gender norms, changing sex and gender norms can pressure the doctrine, discourses, practices and organizational structures of faith institutions, some established centuries or millennia ago. The course considers not only the roles of women and men, or constructions of masculinity and femininity, but also the impacts of non-binary genders and sexualities that may be acceptable (even celebrated) in some religions and shunned in others. We will address urgent and perennial questions from different religious perspectives: what is the spiritual meaning of sexuality? Is sexuality an obstacle or a vehicle for spiritual fulfillment? Who are the voices of authority who set the sacred rules on sexuality and who gets to enforce them? How do we (or should we) balance the tensions of non-aligned government and religious concerns, as in contemporary debates around same-sex marriage; abortion and reproductive rights; legal definitions of ""family""; the Muslim veil in secular contexts; divorce; trans rights; attitudes toward the body; gender mutilation and/or sex-reassignment surgery; sexual violence towards women, gay, and trans individuals around the world; child and sexual abuse among the clergy; and religious leadership and inclusion. The course also touches on the impacts of colonialism, globalization, and migration on gender and sexuality."
RLST 280: Gendering the Divine in Indian and South Asian Religions,"Throughout South Asia, ancient religious beliefs and cultural traditions interact with forms of modernity that constitute the daily lives and practices of women and men today. Focusing on conceptualizations of sex and gender over South Asia's long history, this course investigates the ways in which religious traditions and cosmologies have informed gender roles and hierarchies in India, Nepal, and other neighboring nations from the ancient period through the present day. In so doing, the course also explores how political realities-revolutions, terrorism, elections, nationalist movements, for example-can both exploit and challenge the gendered entanglements of religion and secular life. Students engage basic historical methods as well as feminist analytical methods (e.g., intersectionality) as they read a variety of cultural histories and ethnographies, as well as religious, philosophical and literary texts."
RLST 3: Introduction to the Religions of the East,"Religious experience, thought, patterns of worship, morals, and institutions in relation to culture in Eastern religions.  /  Introduction to the Religions of the East (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course will explore the foundations, development, and diversity of religious traditions in Asia, focusing mostly on Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto. It is organized according to two sections: Foundations and Developments. The Foundations section provides an introduction to the worldviews and practices of Eastern teachings. We will also discuss the structure of society, the social expectations on individuals based on gender and class, and rituals, which expose us to rich mythologies or intricate ceremonies. The second section, Developments, traces the evolution of religious doctrine and practice through history. Here, we learn to distinguish among large and small-scale movements and schools, and to familiarize ourselves with the geographical scope of each religion in South, Southeast, and East Asia. An abiding emphasis in this course will be on how to read and interpret the varied scriptures and primary texts of these religions."

HIST (J ST) 409Y (RL ST 407Y) European Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Present (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course analyzes major episodes in the history of anti-Semitism and tries to clarify the motives and dynamics involved. It seeks to understand what these episodes have in common and what is unique in each case--is there a single universal, eternal antisemitism? Or are there rather 'anti-Semitisms' each belonging to a unique historical context? Is there a single continuous line of development in anti-Semitism? What is the relationship of a particular anti-Semitism to the national culture in which it originates?We will be reading the major original texts of anti-Semitism from Roman and ancient writers, through early Christian texts and medieval Christian Blood Libels against the Jews, documents of the Spanish expulsion, Lutheran tracts, Voltaire's essays, German philosophical texts from Kant to Marx, Wagner's racial essays, the Protocols of Zion, and documents of Nazi anti-Semitism by Hitler and Streicher. The major part of the grade will depend on a short research paper which will be presented in various drafts, so that the final version represents the culmination of discussion and constructive criticism and advice. This course is a parallel course to J ST/ (Zionist History) and J ST/ (Modern Jewish History). This course will count toward the Religious Studies, Jewish Studies, and History majors and minors in the 400-level category."
RLST 410: Jews in the Medieval World,"Trends in medieval Jewish society under Islam and Western Christendom.  HIST 410HIST 410 Jews in the Medieval World (3) (US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The Jews lived in widely scattered communities under Christian and Islamic rule in the medieval period. This course will examine how Jews adapted the traditions they developed in Palestine and Babylonia in the early centuries C.E. to the new conditions they encountered in Europe and the Mediterranean region from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries. It will focus on the general problem of how traditional societies survive in rapidly changing circumstances, particularly when their members are a minority population. The course will aim at developing students' skills in comparative analysis as they compare the adaptive strategies of Jews in different cultural spheres (the Franco-German region versus Spain, for example). They will also be asked to compare the different polemical stances Jews adopted vis-a-vis Christianity, on the one hand, and Islam, on the other. They will be encouraged to understand the ways in which Jews internalized certain aspects of the majority culture and rejected others. It is hoped that they will come to see how deeply Jewish history was intertwined with medieval Christian and Islamic history, despite inter-religious hostilities and the frequent need for Jews to defend against majority aggression.Students will be evaluated on the basis of two mid-term exams (the first after the survey of the Muslim world, the second after the examination of the Franco-German region) and a comprehensive final exam.The course will be linked to most of the courses taught in the field of Jewish Studies, especially J ST 111 (Early Judaism), J ST 114 (Modern Judaism), and J ST 118 (Modem Jewish History from 1492). It will also be linked to offerings in Religious Studies: RL ST 001 (Introduction to World Religions), RL ST 101 (Comparative Religion), RL ST 107 (Introduction to Islam), RL ST 124 (Early and Medieval Christianity), and RL ST 165 (Introduction to Islamic Civilization).

RUS 144: Multicultural Russia: Narratives of Race and Ethnicity in Russian Literature and Culture,"Multicultural Russia: Narratives of Race and Ethnicity in Russian Literature and Culture (3) (GH, IL). Despite media's renewed attention to Russia's domestic and foreign affairs, the fact that Russia-a gigantic land mass stretching all the way from Finland to the Sea of Japan-is, even today, not really a ""nation"" but an ""empire,"" encompassing peoples of many different ethnic, racial, linguistic, and religious backgrounds, remains a little known fact for the American audience. According to a 2005 report by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, more than 170 distinct ethnic groups live within the borders of the Russian Federation. For most of the past two centuries, this empire was even larger and more diverse. While, inside the Soviet Union, this diversity was often celebrated as proof of the ""friendship of peoples"" underlying the Communist state. In the 1920s and the early 1930s, the Soviet authorities promoted the voices, literatures, and cultures of the empire's ethnic and national minorities, as long as they were ""national in form"" but ""socialist in content."" Once the survival of the new state was secured, the so-called Soviet ""nationalization"" campaign was brought to a stop and even reversed in some cases, resulting in silencing of numerous treasures of world literature that offer invaluable glimpses into the lives of an ethnically, geographically, and culturally diverse range of peoples, who identify today as Russian citizens. This course explores the major works by authors representing many ethnic minorities in the territory of modern Russia, as well as works by writers from former Russian and Soviet colonies, such as Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Special attention is also paid to Jewish experience and Russia's encounters with Africa and Africans. Focusing on five major regions-Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Far East, and Africa-the course analyzes primary texts for their rhetorical and poetic effects, the historical and political contexts in which literary discourses surrounding questions of ethnicity, culture, and race develop, and the conditions under which they are marketed to, or suppressed from, different groups of readers. Where applicable, the primary readings are supplemented with short selections from the scholarly literature on theories of race and ethnicity, human rights, colonialism, Russian/Soviet nationality policies, and the politics of censorship and literacy under Communism. The course is taught in English and requires no prior knowledge of Russian culture and history. It offers a variety of class activities - lectures, screenings, guided discussions, group work, and student presentations - and incorporates several elements of active learning - information gathering and analysis, active use of writing, and oral presentations and modeling demonstrations - to help students develop and apply actively their critical thinking and close reading skills. This course fulfills the General Humanities requirement and is designated as an International Cultures course."

Most lectures are powerpoint presentations by invited speakers, which usually will be local physicians sometimes paired with Penn State research faculty. The speakers introduce the disease topic by discussing the basic anatomy and physiology of the system or body part most affected by the disease. (e.g. lungs, heart, kidneys, etc). Once the foundation is established the pathophysiology is discussed. Risk factors and prevention are also highlighted. One important goal of each seminar is to indicate to students how advances in basic science research can impact the understanding and treatment of disease. Students are encouraged to ask questions after the lecture. The speaker(s) remain afterwards to allow students to ask more specific questions about the disease topic. On occasion, speaker physicians also talk about their medical school training and/or life as a practicing physician. The students that enroll in this course receive a letter grade based on attendance (students must attend 9 out of 10 classes), quizzes and a 2-3 page reaction paper on one of the disease topics. Random short-answer quizzes are sometimes administered at the end of a seminar, testing on information presented during the seminar. Also, reading assignments are sometimes given prior to a seminar, or information handout materials are provided during the seminar. If a student needs to miss class due to an evening exam they need to fill out an Excused Absence Form, which can be obtained from the instructor (no other activities are excusable except for athletic competitions for students in varsity sports)."
SC 451: Science Outreach and Communication,"will provide students with the skills and experience necessary to design outreach activities based on their research and interests, communicate their science in multiple modes, and engage with diverse audiences. Lectures will provide foundational material via a focus on the fundamentals of science communication and outreach, as well as some of the pedagogical basics of science education. Guest speakers will build upon this groundwork by leading modules on lesson planning for effective outreach and communicating with audiences through a variety of platforms, including social media, personal or professional blogs, media interviews, and press releases. These guest modules will be supplemented by panel discussions (with outreach and research professionals from Penn State) on science engagement in different settings (e.g., museums, extension meetings, public science lectures, K-12 classrooms, etc.), disseminating research via social media, and creating and integrating research-related outreach into broader impact statements for grant proposals. The design of student outreach projects will provide a unifying thread throughout the semester, as students work in small groups to create, refine, and implement unique outreach activities following best practices outlined in lectures and panel discussions. Students will be encouraged to choose topics outside of their normal studies, expanding their ability to communicate science with which they are less familiar. Students will have multiple opportunities to both receive feedback from their peers and instructors and offer feedback on their peers¿ projects. Students will exhibit their activities at an event, and in doing so, practice the communication and engagement skills they developed throughout the semester. Through this process, students will gain experience disseminating science, as well as confidence in their ability to accomplish successful science outreach. Afterward, students will evaluate and reflect on their experience and use this self-evaluation to refine their activities for future use."

Training and practice with appropriate environmental technologies is included."
SCIED 458: Teaching Science in the Elementary School,"is designed to support teacher candidates in developing their own reflective practice in science teaching for young learners. Candidates in this course engage in a series of experiences that move them from their own understanding of engagement in science, to understanding children's engagement in science, and finally towards methods of designing science instruction for young learners. Central to this work is a focus on reflective practice; expert teachers reflect on their own teaching practices. During this course, candidates learn to be critical of their own learning, instructional design, and teaching. Candidates use this to revise their practice as they grow as science teachers. The course activities, assignments, readings, and placement experiences offer multiple opportunities for candidates to learn essential knowledge and practices to support children,s curiosity about the world. Course assignments and in-class experiences are designed to help teacher candidates understand the importance of engaging their future students in a strongly integrated focus on science content and practice. This encompasses both how scientists work (the practice of doing science and building our knowledge of the world) and how children learn the skills and practices of doing science. Helping children understand the practices of science is of equal importance as helping them learn the content of science. To start understanding ways of supporting children in learning to do science in age-appropriate ways, teacher candidates in this course contrast their understanding and experiences with those of children. Assignments are designed to help facilitate exploration of the links between understanding children's prior knowledge and beliefs, using knowledge of how people learn, and making pedagogical choices to move children towards specific content and practice goals. Candidates consider the role of differentiated instruction and methods of assessment in science teaching. Finally, the course examines methods of adapting science curriculum using knowledge of children and specified learning goals. Teacher candidates bring together what they have learned about the practices of science, social constructivist instructional methods, and assessment to think critically about how to support elementary students learning science across time.  is a part of a block of courses in a PSU teacher education program that is unified by a basic set of principles and a field experience component."

Each session helps students to critically evaluate the effects of gender discussed in their readings and experienced in their everyday lives. The evaluation tools used for this course extend this critical evaluation. Although the specific evaluation methods vary by sections, all sections use some form of reaction papers, book reviews, and/or journals. These writing assignments require students to demonstrate an understanding of the class readings, lectures, and activities, and to offer an evaluation and assessment of these readings and presentations. Because the social construction of gender is intertwined with family, work, religion, education, government, and all interpersonal interaction, the course overlaps with courses in each of these areas. This course meets a General Education requirement in Social and Behavioral Sciences. It can be used as a lower-level sociology course in the Sociology BA major and the Sociology minor. It can also be used as a supporting course in the Women's Studies major and minor."
SOC 205N: Critical Race Theory in the Humanities and Social Sciences,"This course closely examines the place and power of race in America. By tracing the history of how race works in particular American institutions, such as public education, criminal justice, and federal housing, students will gain a deep sense of how social categories and understandings shape material conditions and human welfare. Through the study of policies, court cases, memoirs, documentary films, and freedom struggles, this course will interrogate the many Americas that race has created and their implications for democracy and justice.

All the while, students will use Critical Race Theory methods to reach empathy and strengthen social (GS) and historical (GH) literacies. Discussion, writing, critical reading, and primary source analysis will be integral to this class. Class sessions will include whole- and small-group discussion where active listening and thoughtful participation will be taught and required. Students will be encouraged to explore their own conceptions of race and how those ideas shape knowledge and experience. Ultimately, this is a course that will weave data, theory, and story as we encourage students to move toward empathy through comprehensive understandings of race. This course therefore examines race as both deeply personal and structural."
SOC 209: Poverty in Africa,"African countries are generally considered to be among the poorest countries on the planet. On average, their incomes are low as are their levels of education. Poor African countries also have a range of peculiar characteristics that negatively affect their living standards. As these standards decline, western audiences have increasingly been targeted by aid organizations seeking donations to help the African cause. Despite growing awareness of African poverty, however, few attempts have been made to locate discourses on African poverty within historical, theoretical, and contemporary contexts. This course provides an overview of the key issues foundational for understanding the dynamics of poverty and human development in African societies. It examines various academic conceptualizations of poverty, the dimensions of poverty in African countries, as well as poverty¿s various causes and consequences. The course also intends to highlight the complex nature of the social, political, and economic causes of African poverty and their implications. Furthermore, it will identify the important challenges to poverty alleviation in African societies, the effectiveness of foreign aid, and alternative strategies to poverty alleviation.

"SRA 471: Informatics, Risk, and the Post-Modern World","Provides in-depth study of how security informatics is influenced by the risk and post-modern culture.   Informatics, Risk, and the Post-Modern World (3)The post-modern world provides a changing climate and context for defining and understanding threats, intelligence, decisions, and risk. Likewise, post-modern cultures consist of beliefs that are heavily influenced by psychology, social connectivity, collective behavior, religion, ethnicity, and political systems. This system of systems is heavily dependent upon and influenced by information, information technology, and the web (social informatics). When examining human behavior as it impacts risk, these various social-technical factors must be considered in planning for terrorism, intelligence analysis, and emergency events. As the post-modern world becomes increasingly complicated, the ability to discern, identify, and address threats in terms of risk becomes exceedingly more difficult. Provision of learning underlying psychological, social, political, religious, and technical components of how risk accelerates through various stages will be critical for protection of national and international interests within the security sphere. Security informatics will be at the heart of both recognizing emerging situations and employing tools/agents/measures to assuage emergency, terrorist, or even national disaster events. This course provides the student with a broad perspective to critically examine both theories and practice of security informatics as related to the cultures in which threats emerge asymmetrically. Students will be placed on the role of systems analysts to problem solve and analyze information from a broad bandwidth of information specifically as informed by culture, post-modern thought, psychological intent, and situation awareness. The course will be grounded by participation in case studies and/or analyzing exercises of risk. Students will be required to do comprehensive reading assignments, engage in team cognition-social interaction, and become familiar with social informatics concepts and tools as related to risk, terrorism, and information warfare. As the post-modern world becomes increasingly complicated, the ability to discern, identify, and address threats in terms of risk becomes exceedingly more difficult. Provision of understanding some of the underlying psychological, social, political, religious, and technical components of how risk accelerates through various stages will be critical for protection of national and international interests within the security sphere. As extreme events become more prevalent in society, security informatics will be at the heart of both recognizing emerging situations and employing tools/agents to assuage emergency, terrorist, or even national disaster events."

WMNST 102: Women of the African Diaspora,"Women of the African Diaspora is an introduction to studying the lives of African Diaspora women and the systems of power that shape them across cultures and geographies. The course centers on the politics of race and gender, on notions of origins and belonging and the meaning of resistance as a cultural and political tool. We will engage with patriarchy as a system of power implicated in identity formation and social relations. We will pay particular attention to the ways colonial histories and racial legacies have shaped the experiences of women in Diaspora. To this end, students will explore the complex and contested ways in which multiple economic, political, and cultural institutions affect the lives of women in the diaspora and examine a variety of issues including economy and labor, mobility and Activism, creativity and literary production and spirituality and social change. Rooted in a diasporic and transnational feminist framework, the course addresses issues of power, culture, racial formation, and citizenship and explores spatiality, movement and border crossings. It follows an intersectional approach to the politics of race and gender and engages diaspora as a historical and contemporary condition that addresses the realities of women in African decent as shaped by the legacy of slavery and the contemporary racial and social pattern of globalization. Students will explore broad patterns, changes, and continuities between diasporic communities globally and the way they shaped women's experiences through an analysis of the history of colonization, slavery, independence struggles, nation-building, imperialism, neo-colonialism, revolution, violence and social movements. The course will provide and interdisciplinary perspective to develop a nuanced understanding of the histories and the lived experiences of women of African descent both globally and in the context of their local geographies.

WMNST 303: Race and Gender in the Americas: Latin American and Caribbean Cultures,"Utilizing a theoretical framework of intersectionality, this course examines historical and cultural constructions of race and gender in Latin America and the Caribbean.  /  /  Race and Gender in the Americas: Latin American and Caribbean Cultures (3) (GS;IL) Utilizing a theoretical framework of interesectionaly this course examines how racial, gender, sexual, and class identities are constructed in Latin American/Caribbean societies. The course applies an anthropological perspective to a wide range of countries in the region to reflect on how historical events such as the conquest, colonization, slavery, and independence movements are relevant to understanding the region today, as well as how race, gender, and sexuality inform contemporary themes of empire, nation-building, imperialism, neo-colonialism, revolution, violence, militarization, social movements, religion, neoliberalism, U.S. involvement/relations, and popular culture. The course addresses issues of power, culture, racial formation, and citizenship by incorporating interdisciplinary material beyond ethnography such as newspapers, grassroots media, biographies, films, music, novels, personal testimonies, etc. Rooted in feminist anthropological scholarship, this course emphasizes how power (from above and below) and culture mediate relationships between individual/community agency and institutions/structures. As an effort to encourage students to think about Anthropology and culture beyond superficial or romanticizing celebrations of multiculturalism, food, and music, the course stresses the theoretical importance of situating power and privilege amidst difference. We conceptualize culture not only as socially transmitted patterns of behavior and ideas/meanings, but as a complex and dynamic process/medium grounded in unequal relations in which power is constituted and resisted. The ethnographic emphasis of the course centers on the complex lived realities and voices of people, encouraging students to learn, understand, and respect cultural difference. The course offers students a broad sense of how power is central in the production of knowledge (particularly within the disciplines of Anthropology and History). Students will critically engage an array of topical issues in Latin America beyond dichotomous thinking. Discussion of course material includes contemplating issues of ethics, subjectivity, bias, and privilege. Conversations regarding processes of ""Othering"" and traditional ""us vs. them"" debates that often occur when discussing developing countries will prompt students to situate their own power/privilege and challenge our assumptions and preconceived notions of Latin America. Moreover, this course teaches Latin American Cultures within a global context of racialization. As such it also stresses the historical and contemporary social, economic, cultural and political significance of the U.S. in Latin America, to demonstrate how we are connected and responsible to what happens ""over there.""; In order to promote service learning, a core tenant of feminist pedagogy, this course also offers students the opportunity to participate in an optional embedded program entitled ""Cuba: Identity, Diversity and Popular Culture"". This two week course in Havana, Cuba promotes interactive learning in and outside the classroom with international study. This course component successfully combines academic classes, hands-on activities, and service learning."

Depending on time period, genres will include autobiography, poetry, historical novel, drama, film, nonfiction. Throughout the course we will consider the political and social developments in Italy with an emphasis on issues of special relevance to women. As we approach each text, we will examine such questions as: the significance of its form; the author's use of language; the ways in which masculinity and femininity are constructed; intersections with the text's historical moment; the political, philosophical and/or theological questions posed by the text; the ways in which the text inserts or distances itself from the Italian literary canon; and the text's depictions, re-evaluations and uses of history. Through their journal assignments in class discussion, students will be encouraged to reflect upon the implications of course concepts in their own culture and historical moment. Evaluation methods include participation in class discussion, journal entries, short analysis papers, and a longer (8-10 page) research paper. In Italian. Prerequisite: any 300-level Italian course. This course is conducted in Italian and counts for the Italian major and minor. The ability to screen VHS and DVD videos is necessary.
