AA 100: Introduction to International Arts,"The arts of the world can be simultaneously universal and unique. By conveying qualities of the human condition (mortality, love, lust, virtues, vices, etc.) the arts can be universal. However, the arts communicating these qualities can be as unique as the cultures that produced them. Consequently, the arts are representative of the commonality and diversity of the peoples of the world.   will use the arts to consider similarities and differences among cultures. The primary objective of this course is to develop an appreciation of the arts from a variety of cultures. The scope of this course will be open to all arts from all cultures excluding the United States of America. Given how large a field of study this represents, the course will concentrate on but will not be limited to visual arts, architecture, designed environments, theatre, and music. It will not include all arts from all countries but rather, case studies will be used to provide an in-depth examination of specific examples. Individual case studies will be selected based on qualities indicative of the culture of origin. Care will be given to selecting case studies representative of a wide variety of cultures and time periods. Effort will be made to include examples from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Oceania, South America, and Europe.   satisfies Penn State's General Education Arts (GA) and International Cultures (IL) requirements and serves as the foundation course for the International Arts Minor in the College of Arts & Architecture."
AA 121: Design Thinking and Creativity,"This course is an introductory, general education level course based on the premise that design is a fundamental human activity that everyone engages in one way or another. Design encompasses both the ability to imagine that which does not yet exist and to make it appear in concrete form. Design is a form of deliberate, considered action that seeks solutions to problems and creates useful and purposeful artifacts. Design is simultaneously used as a noun and a verb, and to describe a discipline and many fields of practice. Yet design remains essentially a black box to most people - its methods, processes, and components are mysterious, magical, and opaque. This course will turn the ""black box"" of design into a glass box. The course focuses on the relationship between ideas, tools, and artifacts in order to connect theory, practice, and outcomes. Using theory, practice, and artifacts from a range of design fields (including architecture, landscape architecture, product design, engineering, graphic design, environmental design, and design theory itself), the course will empower students to understand design from the perspective most useful to them and their work - ideas, application, and the things they encounter in the world. The course focuses on the kinds of problems, situations, and processes of thinking that are critical for designers, business professionals, engineers, humanists, social scientists and natural scientists. The course is divided into five distinct units, allowing a thematic and comparative analysis of a breadth of design topics: About Design; Design Thinking; The Elements of Design; Design as a Game; and, a Step-by-Step Guide to Design in Action. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and analyze the role of design in the world and to take action themselves, including: * the breadth of design in the world * the power and responsibility of design * a range of design artifacts * how designers think and work * what creativity is and what it entails * understandings of design, design thinking, and creativity across a breadth of disciplines * the parts of design problems * how the design process can be described * strategies and methods applicable to the stages of the design process There are no prerequisites for this course. The course will serve as an introduction to fundamental ideas of design and complement design-focused courses in other departments/programs across the university. The course satisfies general education requirements for Arts (GA) requirements."

ACS 501: Elements of Acoustics and Vibration,"Vibrational acoustics including mechanical oscillation, forced and damped response, vibration of strings, membranes, rods, bars, and plates.   Elements of Acoustics and Vibration (3) Acoustics is a broad subject that crosses and interacts with many engineering, science, mathematics, medical, and artistic disciplines. This course provides a thorough foundation necessary for studying structural acoustics and vibration problems and the exploration of acoustic waves in solids. A detailed analysis of the single-degree-of-freedom mechanical mass-spring system provides the building block for exploring lumped-element models of more complicated acoustic systems and the phenomena of resonance for forced and damped systems. Multiple-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems are used to investigate the coupled oscillation between oscillating systems, the design of vibration absorbers, and methods for modeling the low frequency behavior of guitars, violins, and vented-boxed loudspeakers. Extending the mass-spring model to an infinite number of degrees-of-freedom leads to a development of the wave equation and its solutions for longitudinal acoustic waves in elastic solids. Boundary conditions and the concept of mechanical impedance are used to explore standing waves in a bounded elastic medium and the transmission of waves between media with different elastic properties. Transverse waves on an elastic string, while fundamentally different from longitudinal waves, obey the same differential equation of motion and the same application of boundary conditions and mechanical impedance. For both longitudinal and transverse wave systems, the mechanical impedance approach and the method of separation of variables are used to study systems with specified boundary conditions. Longitudinal and transverse waves in structures with varying cross-section, density, or elastic properties are also explored. Torsional waves in elastic solids are explored with application to systems with various cross-sectional shapes. Membranes serve as a two-dimensional extension of transverse waves on an elastic string, and provide mode shapes which may be described using rectangular and cylindrical coordinates (with Bessel function solutions). The fourth-order differential equation of motion for flexural bending vibrations of thin beams is derived and solutions are explored using the separation of variables approach for boundary value problems. Finally, the flexural vibration of two-dimensional rectangular and circular plates are investigated. Homework problem sets will illustrate theory and applications to real world problems."
ADTED 510: Historical and Social Issues in Adult Education,Social and historical foundations of adult education in the United States and selected nations.
ADTED 515: Foundations of Educational Research,"Students read the philosophical foundations of education research, study how philosophies influence methodologies, and analyze current educational problems. This course is designed for students entering doctoral programs in the College of Education. Our students are studying to become education researchers within a highly politicized environment. For example, particular definitions of education research and government policies that favor some types of research practices over others provide opportunities for and set limits upon the work of education researchers. Public controversies likewise contribute to challenges faced by education researchers who find their work affirmed or discounted by particular definitions and policies. In order to explore these controversies and to allow students to begin identifying their own ""positionality"" with regard to research, this course begins with a reading of the history and philosophies of education research (primarily focusing on the United States). The course goals are: -     to identify underlying assumptions of competing forms of social inquiry, each determined to uncover new knowledge; -     to bring those assumptions to bear on education research in chosen fields of study; and -     to begin to develop one's own positions in order to direct further study and research. Specifically, through instructor facilitation and group discussions, students will come to understand major philosophical perspectives that permeate and drive research methodologies in education: positivism, postpositivism, interpretivism, critical theory, poststructuralism, and pragmatism. These understandings allow students to recognize the methodological assumptions that inform published research studies and to discover how methodologies might inform the research they wish to conduct as students and practitioners. Although the course is not required by any particular doctoral program in the College of Education, it is suggested for students who consider research important to their future careers and who see benefits in exploring the methodological options available."

AFAM 207N: Jazz and the African American Experience,"The history and evolution of jazz is a significant cultural manifestation of the African American experience. The music and its artists provide a lens through which to examine questions surrounding the African American experience and what it means to be Black in America, engaging with questions about identity, authenticity, freedom, activism, gender, and sexuality, as well as the role of music in African American life. Drawing upon curricular elements from , Evolution of Jazz, and AFAM 100, Living While Black: Themes in African American Thought and Experience, this course traces the history of jazz through an examination of the lives and art of thirty great jazz artists, juxtaposed with an examination of seminal writings of twenty African American poets, playwrights, novelists, critics, activists, philosophers, and scholars. Preliminary objectives will include basic musical information associated with tonality and with jazz. The main objectives of the course are: to explore the antecedents of jazz and the social-historical contexts in which they developed; to explore the pioneering artistry of selected twentieth-century jazz musicians, tracing the evolution of jazz styles in the process; to delve into the lives of these jazz artists and the social-historical contexts in which they lived; to explore the writings of historically contemporary African Americans, which articulate many of the major issues that have shaped black life in America; to enhance appreciation for the art of jazz and for the musical and literary contributions of African Americans; to encourage reflection, empathy, and a greater understanding of the cultural-historical circumstances that have informed the lives and art of African Americans. The narrowing of scope allows for a more detailed examination of the selected jazz artists, their music, and their lives. Similarly, the selected writings will allow students to reflect on the relationships and connections between these writings and the artistry and life experiences of the selected jazz artists. These objectives will be met by utilizing an interactive, multimedia online curriculum, including demonstration videos, a virtual keyboard, music notation files (e.g., Sibelius), audio recordings, audio-video recordings, selected readings, open forums, and discussion boards. Evaluation methods will include quizzes, tests, open forums, discussion boards, and reflection papers. Students will receive GA and GS credit for this course, as well as US designation. The course will not satisfy any requirements for the major or minor in music. All pieces, excerpts, examples, videos, and texts will be made available to students online."
AFAM 226N: Critical Approaches to Hip-Hop,"This course will examine the politics of hip-hop art and culture. To do so, we will place hip-hop in broad historical context and trace its aesthetic and cultural roots from Africa to Jamaica to 1970s New York City and then forward to 1980s gangsta rap and former President Barack Obama's iPod. We will think through the implications of hip-hop's addiction to Italian-American mobsters, bling, and all-things keepin' it real. We will also search for hip-hop's political foundations in funk records, 1960s community organizing, and poetry of the Harlem Renaissance. All the while, we will analyze the varieties of hip-hop politics by paying close attention to how hip-hoppers vie for authenticity, recognition, and power through cultural practices--b-boying/girling, graffiti art, emceeing, djing, e.g.-at odds with the State, inequality, and injustice. We will also situate hip-hop politics within the ongoing history of American social movements. To avoid over-romanticizing, we will equally examine hip-hop's appetite for conspicuous consumption, misogyny, homophobia, trappin', and criminality. A deep understanding of hip-hop politics, then, requires examining its contradictions as well as the ways race, class, gender, sexuality, and geography shape hip-hop--and therefore American-culture, art, and identity. To get at these and other ideas, we will read, listen, and think broadly about why a full understanding of hip-hop truly matters."

AFAM 303: Race and Gender in the Americas: Latin American and Caribbean Cultures,"Utilizing a theoretical framework of intersectionality, this course examines historical and cultural constructions of race and gender in Latin America and the Caribbean.  /  /  Race and Gender in the Americas: Latin American and Caribbean Cultures (3) (GS;IL) Utilizing a theoretical framework of interesectionaly this course examines how racial, gender, sexual, and class identities are constructed in Latin American/Caribbean societies. The course applies an anthropological perspective to a wide range of countries in the region to reflect on how historical events such as the conquest, colonization, slavery, and independence movements are relevant to understanding the region today, as well as how race, gender, and sexuality inform contemporary themes of empire, nation-building, imperialism, neo-colonialism, revolution, violence, militarization, social movements, religion, neoliberalism, U.S. involvement/relations, and popular culture. The course addresses issues of power, culture, racial formation, and citizenship by incorporating interdisciplinary material beyond ethnography such as newspapers, grassroots media, biographies, films, music, novels, personal testimonies, etc. Rooted in feminist anthropological scholarship, this course emphasizes how power (from above and below) and culture mediate relationships between individual/community agency and institutions/structures. As an effort to encourage students to think about Anthropology and culture beyond superficial or romanticizing celebrations of multiculturalism, food, and music, the course stresses the theoretical importance of situating power and privilege amidst difference. We conceptualize culture not only as socially transmitted patterns of behavior and ideas/meanings, but as a complex and dynamic process/medium grounded in unequal relations in which power is constituted and resisted. The ethnographic emphasis of the course centers on the complex lived realities and voices of people, encouraging students to learn, understand, and respect cultural difference. The course offers students a broad sense of how power is central in the production of knowledge (particularly within the disciplines of Anthropology and History). Students will critically engage an array of topical issues in Latin America beyond dichotomous thinking. Discussion of course material includes contemplating issues of ethics, subjectivity, bias, and privilege. Conversations regarding processes of ""Othering"" and traditional ""us vs. them"" debates that often occur when discussing developing countries will prompt students to situate their own power/privilege and challenge our assumptions and preconceived notions of Latin America. Moreover, this course teaches Latin American Cultures within a global context of racialization. As such it also stresses the historical and contemporary social, economic, cultural and political significance of the U.S. in Latin America, to demonstrate how we are connected and responsible to what happens ""over there.""; In order to promote service learning, a core tenant of feminist pedagogy, this course also offers students the opportunity to participate in an optional embedded program entitled ""Cuba: Identity, Diversity and Popular Culture"". This two week course in Havana, Cuba promotes interactive learning in and outside the classroom with international study. This course component successfully combines academic classes, hands-on activities, and service learning."
AFAM 364N: Black & White Sexuality,"This course explains how narrow, ""black and white,"" ways of thinking limit our understanding of the diverse expressions of human sexuality. The course title's double meaning also references the various ways that sexuality is socially constructed in relation to race. For example, we will explore how stereotypical beliefs about the sexuality of people of African descent persist in the United States and have been legitimized historically by various cultural discourses, social institutions, and academic fields. Course assignments will require us to rethink and challenge what we understand as ""sexuality"" and consider its many influences like race, gender, class that shape our emotions, needs, desires, relationships, representations, practices, and public policies. An aim of this course is to begin to make sense of the long, entangled, and inextricable relationship between race and sexuality in the United States."
AFAM 422: Contemporary African American Communication,"A focused study on the continuities between African and African American culture and communication.  /  Contemporary African American Communication (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.

Specifically, it offers an approach to ascertaining the salient features of African and African American communication for community development. Special emphasis is given to the development and rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement. The course utilizes videos, guest lectures, tapes of speeches, etc. to clarify objectives and stimulate classroom discussion. Students will be evaluated on two exams, one oral report, a final paper and class participation. Even though students need 400-level courses for their major and minor, this course is not required for Speech Communication majors. However, it does meet the Intercultural and International Competency requirement because it focuses on the communication of African Americans and how that communication has affected all Americans. The course will accommodate ten students in Speech Communication and ten students in African and African American Studies to ensure active discussion of issues."
AFAM 432: Between Nation and Empire: The Caribbean in the 20th Century,"An exploration of the political evolution of the Caribbean Region over the course of the 20th Century.  /  Between Nation and Empire: The Caribbean in the 20th Century (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course will explore the political evolution of the Caribbean Region over the course of the 20th century. Its focus will be the ways in which imperial rule and the search for national identity have been the parameters that have shaped Caribbean political history over that period. Students will explore, in written assignments and class presentations, the ways in which the region which has historically been a theatre of confrontation among the major powers in the international system continued to serve that role over the course of the 20th century. The costs that have been borne by the people of the region from these conflicts have been enormous and crippling for several societies, especially Haiti, Cuba, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. Among those costs have also been the continued dependence of these societies upon human migration, limited economic strategies of transformation, increasing levels of poverty, and the emergence of a wide variety of political systems that reflect different historical experiences, demographic diversity, varying levels of political autonomy, and a remarkable level of cultural similarities. Evaluation will be based upon two class presentations; one research paper and class participation. The course will be required for students pursuing the African Diaspora minor and for those seeking to broaden their diversity requirements. It can be used to meet non-Western history requirements in the History major."
AFAM 460: African American Philosophy,"This course will explore central questions and themes guiding the evolution of African American philosophy in the 19th and 20th centuries. Our course will study three different movements from the era. We begin with slavery and questions of reason, civility, and nationality. We move on to philosophies of value and culture in the early twentieth century, with the focus on secularization and the historical nature of philosophical truth. Finally, we will read the work of black political philosophers, and the turn to Marxism and Hegelianism. Issues to be discussed include the foundation and source of race as knowledge of the world, the nature of blackness and identity, the nation as a locus of consciousness and action, God's role in the universe, and the possibility of an Afro-Pessimism about these things."
AFAM 463: African American Autobiography,"The African American literary quest for identity and its adaptation to Euro-American culture and autobiographies.   African American Autobiography (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Starting with the slave narratives which initiate the literary quest of African Americans for identity, this upper-division course will examine the trope of writing (the &quot;talking&quot; book) as the (w)rite of passage into the dominant Euro-American culture. The course will identify, describe, and analyze how the major elements of the &quot;quest&quot; found in the slave autobiographies have been adapted as textual strategies by many contemporary African American writers of autobiography, semi-autobiography, and fictional autobiography. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Maya Angelou, Martin Luther King, Alex Haley, Harriet E. Wilson, James Weldon Johnson, and Ernest Gaines. Topics explored will vary from class to class, but will likely consider slave narratives, the role of autobiography in the fashioning of identity and self, gender issues, genre questions, and the historical development of the genre and its shifting preoccupation from slave times through the early twentieth-century, the pre-Civil Rights era, the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power Movement, and the present. The course will prepare students for other courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and will also prepare students to consider the social and cultural issues involved in the role of race in American history. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written out of class, essay and short answer exams, a term-long reading journal reflecting upon issues of the student's own &quot;autobiography,&quot; an oral class presentation, and class participation. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor and will be offered once a year, with 40 seats per offering."

AMST 226N: Critical Approaches to Hip-Hop,"This course will examine the politics of hip-hop art and culture. To do so, we will place hip-hop in broad historical context and trace its aesthetic and cultural roots from Africa to Jamaica to 1970s New York City and then forward to 1980s gangsta rap and former President Barack Obama's iPod. We will think through the implications of hip-hop's addiction to Italian-American mobsters, bling, and all-things keepin' it real. We will also search for hip-hop's political foundations in funk records, 1960s community organizing, and poetry of the Harlem Renaissance. All the while, we will analyze the varieties of hip-hop politics by paying close attention to how hip-hoppers vie for authenticity, recognition, and power through cultural practices--b-boying/girling, graffiti art, emceeing, djing, e.g.-at odds with the State, inequality, and injustice. We will also situate hip-hop politics within the ongoing history of American social movements. To avoid over-romanticizing, we will equally examine hip-hop's appetite for conspicuous consumption, misogyny, homophobia, trappin', and criminality. A deep understanding of hip-hop politics, then, requires examining its contradictions as well as the ways race, class, gender, sexuality, and geography shape hip-hop--and therefore American-culture, art, and identity. To get at these and other ideas, we will read, listen, and think broadly about why a full understanding of hip-hop truly matters."

In doing so, the course draws from in integrates findings from a wide array of disciplines, including evolutionary biology, genetics, neuroscience, endocrinology, behavioral ecology, anthropology, and psychology. After honing their evolutionary skills by investigating reproduction in other species, students will apply evolutionary principles to understanding human mating. Why do we prefer certain characteristics in a mate? How do these preferences differ between and within the sexes, and why? How do mating behaviors vary across cultures, and why are some behaviors more culturally variable than others? Other topics covered include infidelity, sexual jealousy, concealed ovulation, sexual conflict and rape, orgasm, parental care and abuse, and menopause. In understanding the evolutionary basis for a trait, it is helpful to understand its development. Thus, this course also covers the basics of sexual differentiation and investigates how variation in these processes might lead to variation in sexual orientation and gender identity. Students should take away not only a better understanding of human sexuality but also a way of thinking that helps them understand all living things."
ANTH 219N: Spillover: The Anthropology of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"We live in a world of increasing global awareness and public anxiety of emerging zoonotic diseases. Why do infections continue to spillover from wildlife to humans? What will the next outbreak be? Where will it emerge? Will it become a pandemic threat? Answering these questions requires exploring how our biology interacts with social, cultural, ecological, and climatic processes to influence the spillover of infections from animals to humans. This course begins with an introduction to human determinants of infectious disease that have persisted since the origins of agriculture, including: changing modes of subsistence and human settlement patterns, environmental transformation, and social inequalities. We will then explore how these processes shape contemporary pathways of zoonotic spillover and have led to the characterization and mapping of infectious disease ""hotspots."" The course will continue with an overview of emerging zoonoses of global health significance from a biocultural perspective. We will then narrow in on the most salient hosts and transmission pathways, focusing on evolutionary constraints and sociocultural risk factors that shape pathogen host switching. From these examples, we will look critically at the conceptual trends that have shaped our understanding of spillover events as a public health concern, with special attention to synergies and mismatches between locally and publicly perceived health risks. This course emphasizes the value of anthropological approaches in building more holistic and equitable solutions to emerging human health threats, including opportunities for applied anthropology within human health."
ANTH 21: Introductory Biological Anthropology,"(Introductory Biological Anthropology) is designed to introduce students to the fundamental principles and findings of human evolutionary biology. This course provides an overview of current data and theory related to biological variability among living and past human populations and among the extensive fossils that document human evolution. Through comparisons between humans and other mammals, particularly the living nonhuman primates, this course provides an essential comparative zoological perspective with which we can understand the origins, evolution, and diversity of our species. The course is structured around the theory of evolution, the unifying concept of biological anthropology. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to evolutionary theory as well as to the mechanisms of evolution and their relevance for understanding variation in past and present human populations. The course covers current research and topics in human evolutionary biology including evolutionary theory, natural selection, molecular and population genetics, human variation, human biology, primate diversity and behavior, and the paleontological record of human evolution. This course not only introduces students to the core concepts within the field of Biological Anthropology, but also provides a rich foundation for understanding the human condition from a biological and anthropological perspective. By the end of the course, students will be able to 1) explain the theory of evolution and the mechanisms underlying this process; 2) discuss human variation and human biology within the context of primate diversity and adaptations; 3) describe the major behavioral and morphological trends over the course of human evolutionary history and how they relate to modern human diversity.  is one of three core courses required of majors and minors in the Department of Anthropology and can also be used to fulfill three credits of General Education in the Natural Sciences.

Brief written lab exercises foster interactive learning."
ANTH 220: Anthropology and Art/ifacts,"This course examines anthropological approaches to the study of art works, their production, and function in diverse human societies, both past and present.   Anthropology and Art/ifacts (3) (GA GH IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course examines the ways in which the discipline of anthropology has used art and artistic production as an interpretive lens, as a means to understand past human action, cultural behaviors and ancient societies as a whole. To take up this topic, the course is divided into five distinct units allowing a thematic and comparative analysis of a variety of human societies. We will critique the conceptual divide between 'art' and 'artifact' focusing on long-standing assumptions about philosophies of aesthetics, derived primarily from early modern European (Renaissance) notions of 'art'. Geographically, the course content has a global reach, but primarily focuses on the artistic production of the Americas, Africa and Oceania, challenging the label of 'primitive' that has historically been applied by modern Western approaches. During the course of the term, we will conduct analyses aimed at elucidating how scholars have used the interpretation of art objects to better understand the complexity of human experience, specifically in regards to categories such as gender, kinship, social hierarchy and cosmology. Each class meeting will consist of a lecture and also a discussion component, primarily focusing on the assigned readings to ensure complete comprehension and relevancy. Students will be evaluated on essays and exams. This course will satisfy general education requirements and provide a base for other courses in anthropology, art history, museum studies and history."
ANTH 271: Parasites and Human Evolution,"The goal of this course is to advance our understanding of human evolution by studying the ecologies and evolutionary histories of our parasites. Many of these parasites flourish only under very specific human behaviors and habitats, are wholly dependent on us, and have evolved with us for thousands or millions of years. Therefore, by asking when and how we first acquired those parasites, under which environmental and cultural conditions we are the most susceptible, and how the parasites have evolved and adapted to us and we in response to them, we can gain considerable insight into our own evolutionary history. As examples, the lifecycle of tapeworms is dependent on our consumption of meat, the speciation of body and head lice was likely coincident with the development of clothing, and the spread of endemic malaria was likely associated with agriculture. A series of human parasites will be studied in sufficient depth - from biology to genetics to population dynamics and so on - to facilitate a holistic consideration of the implications for human evolution, population history, and culture."
ANTH 2N: World Archaeology,"(World Archaeology) introduces students to the concepts and evidence used in understanding the development of cultural diversity on our planet. This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of the major developments in the early human past. Beginning with hominid tool-users, this course tracks the evolution and eventual spread of humans to all corners of the earth, Ice Age hunter-gatherers, the origins of art, the origins of agriculture and settled village life, and the rise and fall of complex urban civilizations. Through cross-cultural comparisons of indigenous cultures of the past and anthropological theory, students are exposed to topics such as the origins of gender differences in the division of labor, the role of ideology in cultural adaptation, differential access to technologies, economic production, artistic expression, the origins of social inequality, the ways that symbolic representation in the past shaped the nature of shared meaning and values, and the mechanisms of cultural change.  provides a unique perspective for understanding our increasingly complex and diverse contemporary world. Specifically, students will learn 1) archaeological approaches for identifying variability in the development of cultural systems; 2) anthropological concepts and archaeological evidence used to evaluate factors that shape the diversity of past cultural systems; and 3) the tools to explore the dynamic interaction between scientific process, reconstruction of past cultures, and current issues facing societies in an ever-changing world. The course also emphasizes ethical considerations within archaeology to illustrate the role of representations, values, norms, and traditions on reconstructions of past human societies.  fulfills 3 credits of the General Education Integrative Studies requirements by integrating two General Education Domain fields: the Social and Behavioral Sciences (GS) and the Humanities (GH). Students develop competency for combining knowledge across different domains and interpreting the past human experience in light of current issues and concerns. Students thus gain skills in evaluating their own values relative to the deep history of the human past and different ways for structuring and understanding the world. The course also fulfills an International Cultures (IL) requirement by providing an informed perspective on human cultural and behavioral diversity in the past. To achieve these educational objectives,  draws on multiple teaching formats and resources, including classroom lectures, hands-on labs, and readings from a textbook. Students are evaluated based on two exams and their participation and two quizzes in lab section.  is offered every semester."
ANTH 401: Human Evolution: The Material Evidence,Human origins as seen in the fossil record and comparative biology of humans and their primate relatives.
ANTH 40Q: Biocultural Evolution,"Are we ""stuck"" with prehistoric genes in a rapidly changing ecological and cultural environment? What does our evolutionary history really tell us about human nature, health, and well-being? To answer these questions, we must explore the complex interplay between human biology and culture in shaping the human species throughout our evolutionary history - our biocultural evolution. This course is about how we shape our biology, perhaps just as much as it shapes us. Each week, we will explore key topics in human evolution from a biocultural perspective. Through this lens, we will learn how human evolutionary biology shapes our diet, physical activity, reproduction, diseases, and our capacity for culture. In turn, we also examine how our culture has shaped our biological capacities and limitations. Through these explorations, students will critically examine the processes and outcomes of biocultural evolution, including feedbacks between our biology and culture, and the timescales at which evolution occurs."
ANTH 412: Settlement Demography,"Examination of the demography and ecology of human settlement systems in the preindustrial past.   Settlement Demography (3)This seminar will examine the population dynamics of human settlement systems in preindustrial societies, living, historic, and prehistoric. The focus will be on subsistence-level agrarian settlements, but some attention will also be paid to settlement patterns in hunter-gatherers, in market economics, and in complex societies. After reviewing basic assumptions and problems of working with spatial data, the course will examine processes determining settlement size, composition, and location on the micro-level (i.e. that of individual households, farmsteads, hamlets, and villages) and then pass on to regional patterns of transport, migration, and defense. The processes of site colonization, settlement expansion and contraction, site abandonment, and re-colonization will all be considered in detail. Since human settlements are always non-randomly distributed across spatially-heterogeneous landscapes, some basic landscape ecology will be presented in the course. Some fundamentals of geostatistical analysis will also be taught, although the course is not intended to be a survey of quantitative geography or spatial analysis. Rather, it is designed to be a more specialized follow-up to  (Anthropological Demography); the new course builds upon the basic explored in  by extending them into the spatial domain. During the last quarter of the semester, students will split into 2-3 teams, each of which will re-analyze settlement data from a region and time period of its choice for presentation to the rest of the class. The proposed course will provide 3 elective credits toward the undergraduate major and minor, and will be open to graduate students as well. The overall aim is to produce scholars who can think in creative ways about the dynamics of settlement systems in their own reading and research. The course should be of interest to archaeologists, anthropological demographers, ethnologists, and other students interested in human population science, especially as it relates to preindustrial society."

ANTH 445W: Ethnographic Film,"Comparisons of written and visual ethnography; critical assessment of ethnographic film; cross-cultural variation.   Ethnographic Film (3) Students will be presented with both written and filmed ethnographic material dealing with a number of cultural subsystems (e.g., kinship and family relations, religion, political systems) and with a number of different world cultures. The aim of the course is three-fold: 1) to convey through visual anthropology the complexity and inter-relations of cultural subsystems, which is often difficult to do in written sources; 2) to develop the skills of critical viewing of ethnographic film; and 3) to provide students with critiques of their written work that will enable them to learn and practice the skills of clear, organized and convincing writing. Towards these ends, students will be expected to read and view weekly assignments for selected topics, to write twelve critical essays that compare the written and filmed sources, and to evaluate the aims, effectiveness, and methods of the films. Essays will be graded for both content and form and will provide a basis for class discussion. Students will also be required to write a term paper focused on a particular ethnographic film of their choice (one not shown in class) supplemented by additional research. As an aid in the writing of the paper, at least one class period will be devoted to learning how to do library research in Anthropology.This course will complement other courses in Anthropology such as ANTH 045 and ANTH 001.

ANTH 456: Cultural Ecology,"Survey of the methods and concepts of cultural ecology, focusing on the interaction between cultural and geographical systems."
ANTH 45N: Cultural Diversity: A Global Perspective,"(Cultural Diversity: A Global Perspective) is designed to introduce students to the concepts and evidence used in understanding the cultural diversity of our planet. ""Culture"" can be defined as a socially transmitted system of shared conventions, beliefs, practices, and behavior. Cultural systems vary across time and space, and dynamic cultural processes are involved in how humans interact with each other, other organisms, and the environment. This class provides students with the tools to approach questions about the diversity of human cultures, how they vary across different societies, how different people experience and represent social worlds, why they change, and the importance of understanding such variability for the global challenges we face in an ever-changing world. Anthropology takes as its subject the entirety of the human experience, in all of its diversity through time and space. Anthropology thus provides a unique perspective for understanding our increasingly complex and diverse contemporary world. Specifically,  has three goals: 1) Introduce students to anthropological approaches for describing variability in systems of shared human thought, belief, and social practice. 2) Utilize anthropological concepts and evidence to evaluate factors that shape the diversity of cultural systems over time and space. 3) Provide students the opportunity to explore the dynamic interaction between contemporary cultural systems, histories of change, and the physical environment.  is designed to integrate two General Education Domain fields: the Social and Behavioral Sciences (GS) and the Humanities (GH). The course integrates different methods of inquiry and different forms of knowledge about the many factors that interact to influence patterns of convention, practice, and diverse ways of life.  enables students to develop competency for integrating knowledge across different domains and interpreting the human experience through multiple social, historical, and environmental perspectives. Students thus gain skills in evaluating their own values relative to the broad context of diverse ways for understanding the world. To achieve these educational objectives,  draws on multiple teaching formats and resources, including classroom lectures and discussions, readings from general textbooks and primary literature, critical analysis of ethnographic film, and online written materials and podcasts."

ANTH 476 / WMNST 476 Anthropology of Gender (3)Students will learn the current theoretical approaches in anthropology to the cultural construction of gender and sex roles. The first 2-3 weeks of the course will concentrate on exploring and understanding these theoretical approaches. The remaining weeks will focus on case studies of non-western gender systems, and on the practical effects of those systems, but students will also be encouraged to relate these systems to their own experience. Each meeting will be based on discussion of the readings assigned for that meeting and students will be expected to participate. During the period devoted to theoretical approaches, discussion will focus on the assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of each approach. For the part of the course devoted to readings on individual societies, one reading each week will be the basis for a critical essay of approximately five pages. These essays will be expected to include: 1) an identification of the theoretical approach that informs the work, 2) a statement of the author's arguments or questions, 3) a discussion of the methods used to provide data in support of the arguments or to answer questions, 4) a critique of the adequacy of data, and 5) a statement suggesting which additional elements might make for a better study. These essays will be graded for both content and form and students will have the option of rewriting essays (and improving their grade) after they receive comments. These essays will provide 60% of the course grade, while participation in discussions will provide another 15%.A short research paper will also be required. The paper must focus on a question or hypothesis concerning gender, and a preliminary proposal that includes the focus of the paper, its relevance to the course, and a beginning bibliography is required. A first draft of the paper will be required two weeks before the end of the semester. The research paper will provide 25% of the course grade.The course complements other courses in Anthropology that deal with sex differences, but will provide a perspective on gender that is not available elsewhere in the curriculum. The course can be used to fulfill a Behavioral Anthropology requirement in both the major and minor in Anthropology and a writing across the curriculum requirement.

APDEM 804: Business Demography,"This course provides a broad coverage of business demography questions that draw upon knowledge, data, and methods associated with applied demography. The course begins with an overview of the goals of business demography applications, major data and methods, and mega population trends that address practical problems in business. The course addresses several key topics in business demography. Part 1 focuses on the application of local and national population characteristics and dynamics to target consumer behavior marketing and market segmentation. The analysis of demographic data integrated with consumer characteristics data is fundamental to corporate decision making on generational marketing strategies. Part 2 analyzes the impact of demographic factors on business site selection, notably population growth trends and the human capital characteristics of local area labor markets. Integration of current and projected population characteristics with sales data informs local, national, and world business site selection decisions. Part 3 focuses on the impact of mega demographic trends in population size, growth, characteristics, and dynamics on corporate investment strategies in local labor markets, states, nations, and international locations. Part 4 examines within-corporation human resource management problems involving the demography of work force size and characteristics. Worker population entry, turnover, and the flow of individuals through positions in the workplace are analyzed. Part 5 focuses on the interface between demographic characteristics of business client and worker populations and compliance with local, state, and national regulations in the conduct of business. Issues of business non-discrimination and the dynamics of community population characteristics are considered. This course covers a diverse set of topics related to business and corporate activities. It provides students with a substantive understanding of key business demography topics and the population data and analytical tools to help them address practical problems faced by business decision makers. The course concludes with a consideration of possible newly emerging applied business demography issues and future data challenges and opportunities."
APDEM 806: Applied Demography & Health,"This course provides an overview of data, methods, and techniques in applied demography used to help address public health questions. This course provides a wide-ranging coverage of substantive health questions that draw upon data and analytical methods closely associated with applied demography. The course opens with an overview of the substantive connections between health and applied demography. The remainder of the course is divided up into three main parts: (1) Local/Regional Health Assessments; (2) Methods and Case Studies in Morbidity and Mortality; and (3) Emergent Trends in Applied Demography and Health. Part 1 focuses on data needs and commonly used methods (and their limitations) related to local/regional community health assessments - including diverse contexts (rural-urban, developed and developing countries). These data and methods are utilized to examine health disparities, health service planning (based on catchment area analysis and location-allocation modeling as well as methods for measuring accessibility and utilization of health services), environmental pollution, and emergency/disaster response. Part 2 covers the connections between demographics and the epidemiological transition. This section includes a broad focus on a specific classification of human health and disease (i.e., provisioning care and disease prevention, communicable disease, non-communicable disease, and accidents and other causes of injury and death). Across each classification of health and disease the heterogeneity of data needs, time scales, spatial scales, and population at risk is wide. Applications of methods and use of case studies will facilitate the discussion of these different kinds of contemporary health challenges. Part 3 focuses briefly on the future, including an examination of global health questions (broad processes and forecasts associated with migration, urbanization, and environmental change) and new types of data and methods (including challenges and opportunities) that applied demographers will likely use in the next decade. This course covers a diverse set of topics related to human health. Some of the most important health problems of the early 21st Century (in the U.S. and globally) relate to health inequalities in access to resources (e.g., access/use of health services) and in the variation in individual exposure to risks (e.g., environmental pollution, neighborhood deprivation, obesogenic environments, and crime), and how both access to resources and exposure to risk are associated with health disparities across populations (by race, socioeconomic status, gender, age, and other forms of social stratification). This course will provide students with an understanding of key health topics, and specific data and analytical tools that can be used to address them."

ARCH 316: Analysis of Human Settlements: Cities,"This course focuses on the design and analysis of cities from ancient to modern time periods in the U.S. and the world, taking into account the cultural and historical ways human settlements develop, how cities relate to one another, and the wide array of built forms and material culture that make up built urban environments over time ¿ from arcades, squares, and streets to gardens, monuments, and more. If you have a genuine interest in learning more about how cities evolved and the historical and modern issues confronting the many diverse individuals and groups who thought about and influenced the planning of cities, this should be an interesting semester. One broad goal of this course is to enhance your urban literacy by developing the critical analytic skills needed to understand and appreciate cities in all of their complexity. These issues are not only pertinent to urban designers, architects, landscape architects and others who are directly involved in the planning of cities, but they are also vital to the diverse cultures and social groups who inhabit, experience, and also shape urban environments. The design and development of cities is a useful barometer for also understanding the political, economic, ethical, and other forces that guide and shape their development over time. This makes cities challenging to analyze because they are not static forms. They are ever changing and evolving."

ARCH 499A: Rome Study-Architectural Design,"Individual or group instruction conducted in Rome, Italy.  Foreign Study - Architectural Design VI (6) The semester abroad design work will focus on the difficult problem of creating new construction in the presence of an historic structure. This is an inevitable problem in the city of Rome where one can hardly avoid confronting historic or monumental buildings. However, as every place is preceded by a history, either natural, political or material, these issues are important outside of this context, the course aims to help students define critical strategies that will serve them beyond their semester abroad.Fifteen weeks is a short time to experience a place as complex and interesting as Rome, Italy. For many students, it may be a chance of a lifetime to live in and study a place as challenging and full of opportunity as this. Students are expected to approach the semester with even more seriousness then they would a semester at home. A semester in this program is not a mere travel experience but an academic exploration of a foreign and historic environment Every activity of this studio is designed to these ends. Therefore, we have selected a very direct and limited building program, a site in the historic center, and exercises that require students to spend time in the field as well as in the studio."
ARCH 512: Critical Theory in Architecture,"Inquiry into paradigms of critical theory in architecture theory, practice, and teaching.  Evaluation of central texts, methods, theories, and outcomes.   Critical Theory in Architecture (6) is composed of six chronologically arranged units of study that examine the major developments in the evolution of discursive practices that ground architecture theory, teaching, and practice. Modern and post-Modern critical theories in architecture have borrowed from a number of tangent disciplines, such as Phenomenology, Positivism, Existentialism, Narratology, Structuralism, Deconstruction, Grounded Theory (social sciences), Cognitive-Behaviorism, Neo-Kantianism, Psychoanalysis, Reception Theory, etc. Historical methodology, Archaeology, Anthropology Art History, and other disciplines have also had their impact. As a result, critical theory in architecture typically lacks uniform methodologies and stable definitions. In recent years, many disciplines have undergone attempts to consolidate discourse around the influence of language and culture within the historical context of evolving world ideologies and their effect on communication, material culture, and the physical environment. Architecture has responded to this general trend in a number of ways that invite cross-disciplinary comparisons and methodological adaptations. The course will take advantage of featuring visiting scholars whose expertise in diverse areas of study will provide participants with direct contact with the widest possible range of theoretical perspectives. The strategy of the course will be a comparison and critical evaluation of what appear to be the most effective research methods within the pressing concerns of environment, population growth, material resource depletion , and international conflict. The aim will be to establish relevance as well as research competence and effective expression."
ARCH 512A: Doctoral Research Theory,"Inquiry into paradigms of theory in architecture and landscape architecture, as pertain to doctoral level research, practice, and teaching."

ARMY 103: Physical Training Laboratory,"This course is designed to guide students through an intentional physical fitness program. The course follows the ARMY Physical Fitness Training Program, but is open to any student. The design consists of a systematic increase in the intensity or duration of physical activities. Proper progression allows the body to positively adapt to the stresses of training. When intensity or duration is increased too rapidly, the student cannot adapt to the demands of training, and is unable to recover, leading to overtraining and possible injury. The following are gradually increased to produce the desired physiological effect: - Intensity (resistance and pace). - Exercise volume (number of sets and repetitions). - Duration (time). In the toughening phase, the duration of the ability group runs (AGRs) progress from 10 minutes to 30 minutes gradually over the training cycle. The pace also gradually increases over time. For example, in the sustaining phase during the conduct of CLs and speed running, Soldiers progress from wearing the individual physical fitness uniform (IPFU) to Army combat uniforms (ACUs), boots, advanced combat helmet (ACH), and improved outer tactical vest (IOTV). Progression in strength is achieved by increasing one or more of the following for each exercise when using strength training equipment. - Resistance (weight). - Number of sets. - Number of repetitions. Adhering to the scheduled intensity and duration prevents the Soldier from progressing too fast. How fast the Soldier should progress also depends on how regularly he performs challenging activities and how much rest and recovery time he gets. PRT time is a valuable resource, especially during the toughening phase. Every PRT session develops strength, endurance, and mobility. To ensure improvement, PRT sessions in IMT occur 5 or 6 times a week and last 45 to 60 minutes. PRT sessions in the sustaining phase last 60 minutes or more and occur 4 to 5 times a week. If PRT cannot be conducted first thing in the morning, it should be conducted at some other time during the duty day. Training sessions should be sequenced to ensure adequate recovery."

ART 170N: Plant and Microbial Art,"This inter-domain general education course provides a cross-disciplinary platform for plant- and microbe-facilitated creative production and art-mediated scientific learning. The course balances studio art activities with lecture- and discussion-based learning about integrated science and art topics. Students use the media of plant and microbial pigments, growth, and biology in a hybrid studio-lab environment. The biology, chemistry, and physics of these living and life-derived media are expected to form integral parts of student presentations. Lectures will provide information about broad scientific principles and in-depth learning about specific phenomena underlying the biologically-based media as well as relevant bio-art issues and contexts in which work is produced. Student projects will represent an integration of natural science understanding with artistic expression. Students will be encouraged to go in various directions with their creative efforts, including visual mechanics (light, color, composition), mark making (painting, drawing), meaning making (metaphors, allegories, cultural appropriations), storytelling, sensing (ways of seeing, phenomenology), and new media issues (e.g., post-humanism). Some example types of bio-media and their scientific connections include: plant pigments, which facilitate discussion of light, photosynthesis, basic chemistry and chromatography; bacterial cultures, which facilitate discussion of microbiology, cell biology, and cellular movements; and fluorescent proteins, which facilitate discussion of DNA, RNA, protein structure, mutations, species concepts, and genetic engineering. Student projects integrate the scientific basis of the bio-art media used such that the media become part of the message of the art."

ART 51N: Meteorology and Visual Arts: To Know is to See,"This course examines the inter-relationship between what we know and what we see, through an introductory exploration of art and science. Engaging students in the study of weather formation, mainly clouds, artistic depictions within the genre of landscape, and the expressed practice of painting; fosters the development of observational skills necessary for reading the landscape and interpreting collected data. What we know and what we see is an on-going evolution of development; syncing the old with the new. Therefore, observation and interpretation are essential to critical thinking, making the intersection between art and science a fertile ground for discovery and learning. The exciting part of the course is the large amount of overlap in the general ideas and thought processes used in meteorology and art, especially when using clouds as the connective tissue. Scientists and artists are both detail oriented and worry about the quality of their work. Both involve collecting data to find the best approaches to a problem, and reasoning through challenges that arise. Students will be challenged throughout the course to seek these connections and how perspectives from each discipline inform the other. Meteorology and art have long been aligned in a common quest to understand how the world works, each seeking interpretations and explanations using a range of complementary and contrasting practices and perspectives. Clouds come in a vast array of sizes and shapes, and are depicted in art using a variety of techniques, creating a shared focus for a deeper understanding of both areas of endeavor. Students will learn about the concept of mixing, which is important to cloud formation and to painting. Students will conduct experiments to learn about cloud processes, and will learn and practice artistic techniques to convey atmospheric conditions. Ideas from both perspectives will be integrated in analysis and discussion. Data from instruments and the individual artist will be collected, shared, and analyzed. Learning how clouds form will help with painting, and questions and perspectives that arise from painting will increase the understanding of cloud processes. The common threads in this approach are a curious mind, a strong detail-oriented focus, effective communication, and respect for the creative tension between ambiguity and assurance in the search for a better sense of causes, connections, and incessant changes."

ARTH 105N: Pictures and Power,"Pictures and Power (3) (GA) (GS) (BA)  In an era in which information is increasingly visual, and in an age in which our environment is ever more packed with imagery, students need powerful tools with which to interpret, compare, use and challenge images. This class is about the ways in which popular imagery pleases, informs, persuades, and otherwise exerts power. The class will analytically explore popular imagery and the influence it has exerted historically and today. The class will also acquaint students with works of art that have informed, attempted to draw upon or even contested the power of popular imagery. Particular emphasis will be placed on the interrelatedness of imagery; just as religious paintings of the Renaissance often exerted their force their meaning by virtue of their companionship with architectural sites, music and ritual practices, contemporary popular imagery (from graffiti to broadsides to memes) depends upon the larger constellation of events and artifacts in which they are embedded. The class will equip students with interpretive techniques by which they can examine and think critically about the power worked by pictures, those that exerted influence in the past as well as those students are likely to encounter day-to-day, including selfies, fashion spreads, and corporate logos and product labels."
"ARTH 107N: Rocks, Minerals, and the History of Art","This online course investigates select rocks and minerals used in the production of art between the Prehistoric Era and the Early Modern period. Topics covered include chemical and physical properties, occurrence in nature, the processes by which natural materials are acquired and worked, their symbolic and monetary value, and specific works of art in which they are found. Each material (ochre, garnet, lapis lazuli, rock crystal [quartz], igneous rocks [basalt, diorite and porphyry], alabaster and marble) is addressed in a 2-week unit. The seven units are split equally between scientific analysis of the materials and art historical case studies. A final project integrates Geosciences and Art History topics to investigate the use of a chosen natural material in a specific work of art. Each material addressed in the course plays a crucial role in the history of art, and each one was particularly prized for its physical and material properties (color, hardness, etc.). Ochre was the first known pigment, and was in use by early humans for bodily adornment and for drawing and painting in caves and shelters as early as 100,000 years ago for bodily adornment and 40,0000 years ago in cave art. Its availability worldwide and in multiple strong colors made it a desirable choice. Lapis lazuli, by contrast, was difficult to obtain, and difficult to refine as a pigment. It was first used to make small sculptures and cylinder seals in the Ancient world, and was prized for its brilliant blue color. The difficulty in grinding and purifying blue pigment from lapis lazuli made it one of the most expensive pigments in the Medieval and Renaissance world--it was worth its weight in silver! Pure blue lapis pigment, when found in a painting, is always a sign of great expense and importance. Rock crystal was valued for its clarity and purity, and its extreme brittleness meant that works made from it were valued for their intricacy and fragility. Nero reportedly destroyed two elaborate crystal goblets in a rage, and in so doing, deprived future generations of masterpieces of the sculptor's art. In the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt, rock crystal was frequently used for amulets and other magical objects, while in the Medieval world, its purity was seen as a metaphor for the Virgin Mary. Garnet had a similar symbolic value in the Middle Ages: its red color was related to the blood of Christ, and it was thus used frequently in liturgical vessels. In the Ancient world, the rich red tone of garnets was prized in jewelry and in small-scale relief carvings. Igneous stones like porphyry, basalt and diorite were particularly prized for their extreme hardness and permanence, and thus the Law Code of Hammurabi was iinscribed on basalt to ensure its permanence. Other Ancient Near Eastern rulers had images of themselves made from basalt and diorite in order to ensure that those works would survive for centuries. Imperial porphyry, an igneous stone with a rich red-purple color, came from a single remote quarry in the Egyptian mountains. Its use was reserved just for the Imperial family in Rome, and it was used for carved sarcophagi, for columns, for colored veneers on floors and walls, etc., as a sign of Imperial authority. Marble is of course one of the most familiar of all art materials, used frequently for sculpture from the very beginnings of art production. The Greeks and Romans in particular took great pains to obtain different types of marbles with specific colors, veining patterns, etc., for use in both sculpture and architecture. Finally, alabaster is one of the easiest of all stones to work: it is so soft that one can make a mark simply with a fingernail! Its intricate banding and translucency made it a favorite material for thin-walled bowls and vases in the Ancient Near East, Ancient Egypt, and in the Classical world. Later, in Early Christian and Medieval Italy, it was used for windows instead of glass--sun shining through alabaster casts a golden glow into a church interior. By the Late Gothic period, alabaster was being exploited as an easily sculpted material throughout Europe, with major quarries and workshops in England (Nottingham), France, and Northern Spain."

ARTH 222N: Intersections between Art History and the History of Psychology,": Intersections between Art History and Psychology Why is there a cultural association between mental illness and artistic creation? What is the history of this association? Is there a psychological foundation for it or is it a cultural stereotype with no basis in reality? To address these questions this course will explore the integrated histories of modern psychology and avant-garde art from the late 19th century to the present, comparing the different approaches to the topic in the disciplines of art history and psychology. We will discuss the possible benefits and drawbacks of each approach. By celebrating genius, art history has often been complicit in perpetuating the stereotype of the ""mad"" artist, even romanticizing it and discounting the reality of disease; whereas psychologists often view images as symptoms, misinterpreting the art historical context in which artists work. Interestingly, avant-garde art has often been associated with ""insanity"" with both negative and positive connotations. As a history of art and psychology course, the syllabus is organized as a chronological survey focusing on points of intersection between avant-garde art and psychology. Many of these points will be the lives and works of individual artists who either suffered mental illness, such as Vincent van Gogh, or engaged with psychology and mental illness as the subject of their art, as did Edvard Munch, the creator of the famous image, The Scream. In each case it is interesting to look at the reciprocity between the two disciplines: how the artists represented mental illness and transformed psychological theories into visual art and how psychologists and the medical establishment have responded to these artists, using them as diagnostic subjects. We will look specifically at bi-polar disorder and the psychological debates surrounding its relationship to artistic creativity. We will also look at larger avant-garde movements such as Expressionism and Surrealism, movements inspired by therapeutic practices, the art of mental patients, and psychoanalytic theory. We will look at the legacy of each of these movements in contemporary avant-garde art, including attitudes toward Outsider or Visionary artists and modern art therapy. Particular emphasis will be placed on psychoanalytic theory. Sigmund Freud's interest in art impacted his work and has rendered his writings conducive to artistic interpretation even today, although his theories have been rejected by many contemporary psychologists. We will look at artists who directly responded to Freud's writings such as Max Ernst and Salvador Dali, female surrealists such as Leonora Carrington, and issues surrounding ""hysteria"" as it was adopted by both male and female surrealists as a model for creative expression, and which continues to inform feminist art practices today. While contemporary avant-garde artists continue to respond to various psychological theories and practices, contemporary psychologists use formal analysis to understand the art of mental patients and employ artistic practices in the development of modern art therapy."

This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. We begin with a discussion of the pre­-Vedic Indus Valley civilization reflecting upon its influence on later south Asian cultures. The course then traces how the Vedic ritual tradition, and the Vedantic philosophy gave rise to the concepts of Karma (individual action and its underlying motives), Samsara (the cyclical view of life), and the Atman (nature of the individual). Moreover, we pause here to explore the relationship between the emerging idea of civic responsibility (Dharma) and its relationship to the Vedic and Vedantic thought. Next we examine how the Vedantic philosophical tradition may have incorporated a diversity of philosophical views including both Brahmanical as well as non-­Brahmanical traditions of Buddhism, Jainism, Lokayata, etc. The class will read excerpts from the religious literature of the era. The first part of the course concludes with selected readings from the Bhagavadgita, Mahabharata, as well as some Buddhist and Jaina texts. All of these readings will be in English. Class discussions focus on how the classical Hindu worldview may have emerged from the philosophical foundation of the Vedantas, and later built the groundwork for the Hindu Bhakti (devotion) movements. The second part of the course focuses on the various regional Bhakti traditions from the middle ages onwards, analyzing how the regional cultures may have related with the great classical Brahmanic tradition. The course concludes with a discussion of how Hinduism in the post 1800s responded to the forces of colonization, exploring how the different religious and cultural traditions of south Asia may have interacted with other religious cultures (both indigenous and foreign) like Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, and Christianity. We shall read excerpts from noteworthy thinkers and writers of nineteenth and twentieth century to understand the very interesting dynamics between religion and civil society of more recent times.

"ASIA 414: Chinese Language, Culture and Society","The study of Chinese language and culture and a perspective on the way of life in contemporary Chinese society. Through this course, the students are introduced to a cognitive approach to the study of Chinese language and culture and a broad perspective on the Chinese way of life in contemporary Chinese society. In particular, we will study how the interaction between Chinese language and culture frames the worldview of Chinese speakers, how the usage of the Chinese language manifests the underlying conceptual structure, which in turn is shaped by the physical (including bodily) and cultural experience of its speakers, and how conventional usage of linguistic expressions of Chinese reflects, and possibly influences, the ways in which Chinese speakers see or conceptualize the world. We will focus on conventionalized expressions, which include compound words, idiomatic phrases, and proverbial sayings, in the Chinese language, and study the Chinese conventional ways of talking about reality, both external and internal, as windows into Chinese culture and cognition. More generally, we will try to understand the embodied nature of human cognition as we see how abstract thought is grounded in bodily experience in and with the physical and cultural world. We will also look at various domains of life in contemporary China in order to gain a better understanding of Chinese society. The objectives of this course are threefold: (1) to lead Chinese language students to a linguistic approach to language analysis so that they learn about how individual linguistic expressions fit into a coherent linguistic system; (2) to enable them to see how linguistic structures reflect underlying cognitive, conceptual structures which are derived from the interplay between human embodiment and cultural environment; and (3) to provide them with a broad perspective on contemporary Chinese society."

BIOL 406: Symbiosis,"Mutualisms (interactions between two species that benefit both of them) occur in every habitat on Earth, and nearly every species on the planet is involved directly or indirectly in one or more of these interactions. The influence of mutualisms transcends levels of biological organization from cells to populations, communities and ecosystems. Mutualistic associations, such as our microbiome and agricultural symbioses, are critical for human health and welfare. Mutualistic symbioses played a fundamental role on the origin of the eukaryotic cells and the evolution of multicellularity. In addition to the key role played by mutualism in the evolution of complex lifeforms on earth, mutualistic association are instrumental to understand how some important ecosystems such coral reefs and hydrothermal vents function. Mutualistic symbioses are critical for nutrient cycling in the environment and the reproduction and dispersal of numerous plant and animal species. This course will focus on unifying concepts that cut across different forms of mutualism. We will explain and tests these concepts analyzing classic examples of mutualisms. We will define and categorize the diverse array of symbiosis occurring in nature. We will explore the evolutionary origins and implications of mutualistic symbiosis, investigate the population, community and ecosystem ecology of mutualisms and we will assess current anthropogenic threats to mutualisms, their potential for resilience and the role of mutualisms in conservation. Finally, we will explore in detail the metabolic linkages using selected nutritional symbiotic mutualisms examples.

BIOL 424: Seeds of Change:  The Uses of Plants,"It is not possible to conceive of civilization, or life on earth for that matter, without plants. Through photosynthesis and oxygen production, plants are the major producers of biomass and constitute the base of the food pyramid. Plants also have evolved astounding diversity of forms, sizes, shapes, colors, smells and chemical compounds. This structural, nutritional and chemical flexibility has been put to innumerable uses by people, from hunter gatherers to the scientists in search of a cure for AIDS. Plants are at the core of our everyday necessities (food, clothing, shelter, medicines, beverages), simple pleasures (flower, fragrances) and pervasive problems (energy supply, drug addition, famine). Plants have changed civilization in dramatic ways in the past. Witness, for example, the spectacular alterations in diet and the increased population growth catalyzed by the Columbian Exchange. In the future we expect that plants will continue to affect people through an increasingly complex interplay between new technologies such as genetic engineering, the pressure on natural resources, and the search for new crops, medicines and biomaterials."

BUS 502: Business Research Applications,Critical evaluative techniques of business research.
BUS 580: Business and Sustainability,"An inter-disciplinary and global perspective on the business case for social responsibility, environmental stewardship, and transparency in corporate governance. This course provides an overview of principles and practices from the natural and social sciences, arts, humanities, and professional disciplines that contribute to understanding and responding to increasing concerns over the consequences of world population growth (now in excess of eight billion people), climate change, energy, natural resource use, environmental degradation, and calls for a more fair distribution of limited and diminishing resources. Issues of corporate sustainability and social responsibility are examined particularly as they pertain to the development and application of business strategy and practices that build social equity, and restore environmental quality while maintaining long-term profitability and enhanced competitive advantage. While the concept of sustainability has existed for some time, it is relatively recently that managers have started to explore its applications to organizations and managerial behavior beyond the basic ideas of corporate social responsibility and recycling. This course moves beyond these basic ideas to place sustainability in its historical and conceptual context by examining the history and definitions of sustainability in organizational management, the role of current drivers and stakeholders, and the advantages and disadvantages of various frameworks and methods for integrating and managing sustainability within organizations, and in their environments. Selected examples of contemporary research and organizational cases will be analyzed to gain a sense of effective and ineffective approaches to sustainability, as well as addressing issues of standards, measurement, and transparent reporting."

BUSAD 545: Negotiation Strategies,"This course covers strategies and tactics for understanding conflicts, for negotiating effectively, and for dealing successfully with power in organizations.  BUSAD 545BUSAD 545 Negotiation Strategies (3) Although situations involving international incidents, corporate acquisitions, or national collective bargaining contracts demonstrate the dramatic effects of the need for negotiation, it is something that most people do every day. Negotiation is not a process reserved for skilled diplomats, top salespeople, or leaders of labor unions. The structure and processes of negotiation at the interpersonal level are fundamentally the same as at the corporate or international level. For this reason, knowledge about and skill in negotiating is essential to anyone who works with and through other people to accomplish objectives. It is part of the normal ""give and take"" of any business situation, such as negotiating salaries, arranging deals with vendors, or allocating resources for a project. Unfortunately the ability to simply recognize conflict and the need for bargaining does not insure successful negotiating situations. Negotiation is a complex human activity, involving a dynamic interpersonal process. The skilled negotiator possesses a number of skills including: the intellectual ability to understand the key facts that shape and characterize different negotiation situations; the skills to diagnose problems and select appropriate strategies and approaches to address them; and the understanding of one's own personality and value system, which affect the perception of a situation and the choice of tactics and strategy. Negotiation is a learnable process. In this course students will learn how to recognize and resolve conflict through bargaining, what the bargaining process involves, and how to plan and carry out a successful negotiation."
BUSAD 555: Full Range Leadership Development,"Development of behavioral skills associated with outstanding leadership of individuals, teams, and organizations through advanced information technology, experimental exercises, and case analysis.  BUSAD 555BUSAD (LEAD) 555 Full Range Leadership Development (3) Leadership is one of the world's oldest preoccupations. Since the beginning of civilization, prophets, kings, rulers and managers have struggled to find answers to an important question: Why do most leaders or managers elicit merely competent performance from their followers, while a select few inspire extraordinary achievement? Given increased globalization, diversity, restructuring, e-business and innovation in today's business environment, finding answers to this question is important for maintaining organizational competitiveness.The purpose of this course is to provide answers to this question by identifying traits and behaviors associated with outstanding leaders, explaining how they get results, and why their leadership often exceeds all expectable limits. This course is designed to introduce students to a) behaviors associated with outstanding leadership, b) social learning and cognition in organizations as a context to promote outstanding leadership, and c) leadership development as a strategic intervention to enhance individual, group, and organizational motivation and performance.The course will be run as a graduate seminar. We will interact through Web site technology, general group discussions, team projects, lecturettes, case discussions, exercises and videos. Class sessions will focus on issues raised by the readings, cases, and issues relevant to students' organizational experiences. A portion of the class time may be set aside for the coordination of team projects."

BUSAD 585: Research in Security Valuation,"Analysis and valuation of equity investments.    Research in Security Valuation (3)  focuses on the analysis and valuation of a firm's equity securities in the financial market using a fundamental analysis. Students will learn how to use different valuation techniques for different types of companies (e.g., companies in financial distress/bankruptcy, private companies, start-up companies with no earnings). The course integrates topics discussed in various finance courses to help students to develop their analytical ability to identify strategies that enhance value creation. The philosophical basis for this topical integration is that valuation of a firm's securities requires one to know not only the accounting issues involved in the preparation of financial statements and how to analyze financial statements, but also to understand the impact of monetary policy, the operation and regulation of financial markets on the value of the firm's equity securities. Moreover, because firm value depends on how well the company is managed, a good understanding of its operations in the global markets, its internal control and risk management strategy is also essential. Finally, because valuation is also based on quantitative models, knowledge of quantitative methods is paramount."
BUSAD 824: Finance and Investment for Sustainable Growth,"In-depth exploration of the methods of financing available for sustainable growth in developed and emerging markets.   Finance and Investment for Sustainable Growth (3)  provides students an in-depth exploration of the theories and the applications that financial professionals can leverage to simultaneously earn a profit and have a positive impact on society. The specific financial sectors students will examine are: Capital Markets (to address environmental issues), Commercial Banking (to create sustainable economic development), Project Finance (to reduce poverty and create infrastructure development), and Investment Management (to understand and employ socially responsible investing)."
BUSAD 827: Fixed Income Securities,"This course focuses on the various fixed income securities including bonds (treasury, corporate, municipal), mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, interest rate derivatives, and credit derivatives. It will build upon that knowledge in order to understand fixed income portfolio management, with focus on portfolio construction, managing versus a benchmark, and measuring and managing risks."
BUSAD 843: People Analytics,"This course develops students' process modeling, data analytics, and decision-making skills regarding the management of people in an organization. Analytics includes data collection, organization, storage, analysis, and all the tools and techniques used to describe current processes, assess and address challenges, and plan for changes. Before managers can make use of people analytics, they must understand and describe human resource processes as well as the relevant databases, information systems, and other information and resources available. Students in this people analytics course will develop an understanding of traditional work processes, HR management requirements, and HR information system architectures in the context of data-driven approaches to decision-making about people in organizations. Students will learn to model HR processes, develop queries, analyze data, and generate reports to make strategic decisions in areas of HR practice such as selection, compensation, performance evaluation, productivity management and enhancement, training and development, and occupational health. Students will also learn to use process and outcome metrics to evaluate business outcomes and to assess diversity, equity, and inclusion goals as well as other strategic initiatives.  Some hands-on work will be required. This will consist of a series of exercises to be used with an employee database. A series of managerial questions will be provided which can be answered utilizing this database. Students will develop approaches towards answering some of these questions and then seek answers in the database. Students will propose their own answers to at least two of these exercise questions. Students will also have the opportunity to model a real-world management challenge and evaluate the analytical techniques that would be used to reach an outcome or decision.  Overall, students will cultivate a leadership perspective that values and practices evidence-based decision-making, develop a deeper understanding of how people data associated with HR processes can increase the likelihood of success for organizational change efforts, and enhance their analytical skills by evaluating people data and by interpreting and meaningfully communicating findings."

CAMS 10U: MESOPOTAMIAN CIVILIZATION,"This course will introduce students to the history of the civilization and the culture of Ancient Mesopotamia (Modern Iraq), which contributed to shape both the Western world and the modern Middle East. Ancient Mesopotamia was a land of contrasts between city and countryside, between sedentary and nomadic populations, between official cult and popular religion, between royal ideology and political skepticism. This course will encompass the variegated nature of this civilization and all the cultures that determine the nature of the historical records (written texts and material culture), through which one can reconstruct the history of Mesopotamia, and, in general, the whole Syro-Mesopotamian region. Furthermore, the connections between this region and other areas of the Ancient near East (Iran, Anatolia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt) will be explored."
CAMS 110: Introduction to the Bible: Old Testament,"The Old Testament (or, Hebrew Bible) is the record of the interaction between the people of ancient Israel and their God. As a religious text, the Bible is inextricably intertwined with the cultures of Israel's neighbors, including the Canaanites, Syrians, Greeks, Assyrians, Babylonians, Arabs, Egyptians, and the peoples of the eastern desert. To study the Hebrew Bible and its development during the first millennium BCE is to study the history, culture, and literature of the entire region. This course introduces students to the literature of ancient Israel, its rituals, the stories which established a people's identity, and which defined their moral behavior. Great figures of the texts, such as Moses, David, Solomon, Bathsheba, Ruth, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezra, teach us important lessons about life and how people of faith attempted to relate to one another, to God, and to people outside their ethnic group. Students will read from the biblical text, as well as from secondary source readings which contains scholarly opinion from a variety of sources. Recent archaeological and epigraphical studies will be incorporated into the course to enhance our work. The ultimate goal will be to assess the meaning of the texts in their ancient Near Eastern environment; to understand the development of Hebrew religion and the beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism; and to understand the connection between biblical studies and other fields of study, such as History, Religious Studies, Archeology, Linguistics, and Comparative Literature."
CAMS 113: Jewish Myths and Legends,"Comparative study of diverse interpretations of stories from the Bible in Judaism and Christianity.  /  /  /  Myths and Legends of the Jews (3) (GH;IL) The impact of the Bible on Western Culture is immense. Beyond its religious importance, the motifs and images from its myths and stories permeate literature and art, providing a basic frame of reference that for much of history could be taken for granted. A degree of familiarity with these motifs so as to be truly fluent is no longer common, and so it requires special effort to discern allusions to biblical traditions. Moreover, these traditions are not static: religious communities continually re-interpret them and appropriate them in very different contexts. Many prominent traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not appear explicitly anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, but are the product of imaginative and ingenious interpretation and re-tellings. Why, for example, is Noah an example of a righteous person in Christian tradition, but in rabbinic tradition is more often portrayed as a profane, earthly-minded man who was saved only because he was the least bad of an evil generation? Why is Moses commonly portrayed with horns in medieval art? Underlying such different traditions are centuries of debate and reflection on these texts as sacred scripture, and competing religious communities often authorized their distinctive beliefs and practices by reading them into scripture. The differences are often too subtle to discern apart from careful comparison. This course will explore the boundaries between Scripture and tradition by means of a close examination of the myths and stories in the Hebrew Bible and their subsequent interpretation and re-tellings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Using methods from comparative mythology and folklore, as well as comparative midrash, our procedure will be to compare these traditions closely with the biblical text, asking: What are the main motifs in the mythology of Judaism? Does Judaism have a coherent mythology? How do their myths compare with the myths of their neighbors? Where did these myths come from? How do these traditions relate to the Bible? What was the function of these myths? Why are there competing myths? How is it possible that Judaism affirms belief in only one God, but has myths that include other divine beings? We will also compare with later interpretive traditions (Jewish, Christian, Islamic). Can we trace trajectories of interpretation? Can we discern particular interpretive methods in operation? We will seek to answer: what do these re-workings of the traditions tell us about the development and function of Scripture, and the social circumstances of the communities? Finally, we will seek to detect reflections of these interpretive traditions in literature and art from the medieval to the modern periods. The course is organized around major topics in the Jewish Scriptures: God, creation, heaven and hell, Torah, Sabbath, Abraham and other ancestors, Israel and holy land, exile, and Messiah. Throughout we will consider how sacred stories function to form ethical perspectives and values."
CAMS 142: Sport and Spectacle in the Ancient Mediterranean World,"Sport and Spectacle in the Ancient Mediterranean World (3) (GH;IL) (BA). This course presents a comparative social history of sport in the ancient Mediterranean world. Of central interest are the culturally distinctive practices of Greek athletics and Roman spectator sports. Other topics for study and discussion include the earlier history of sport in Bronze Age Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Aegean. The course begins its survey with the origins and development of Greek athletics in the context of the Olympic Games. Students will familiarize themselves with the program of Olympic events from the stade race to the pankration. They will also learn about the athlete's career, social status, regimen of training, and what the prize of victory was. The second part of  explores the history of spectator sports in ancient Rome, including the chariot races in the circus and animal hunts and gladiatorial combat in the amphitheater. Students will compare Rome's public entertainments with Greek athletics and inquire why spectator sports evolved so differently in those two societies.  fulfills the Bachelor of Arts requirements in Humanities and in International Cultures."
CAMS 160: Sacrifice in the Ancient World,"Sacrifice (from Latin sacer ""holy + facere ""to make"") is one of the most prevalent yet troubling aspects of religion. Its destruction and violence is often at odds with other rituals and core understandings within a religion, so why is it done and what good does it do? For the sacrificer, does it represent a gift to the gods, a renunciation, an exchange, a surrogate, or something else? This course will examine some competing definitions and theories of sacrifice, as well as its manifestations in the cultures and religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, especially those of Greece, Rome, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Hatti, Israel, and Phoenicia. A brief look at religious sacrifice elsewhere, such as ancient Mesoamerica and India, will conclude the course."
CAMS 180: Ancient Warfare,"Historical survey of the evolution of warfare in the ancient Mediterranean region from prehistoric times to the Later Roman Empire.  CAMS (HIST) 180 Ancient Warfare (3) (GH;IL) Warfare has occupied a central place in the civilizations of the Mediterranean from the earliest times. The prehistoric origins of warfare is a hotly debated topic and constitutes the starting point for this course. Most scholars are agreed that military culture grew in step with sociopolitical development over the course of the third millennium BCE. In the following centuries, the Egyptians, and later the Assyrians and Persians, took great strides in developing sophisticated tactical systems, using infantry, chariotry, and cavalry. These matters occupy a little over the first third of the course. Across the Aegean Sea, Bronze Age (Mycenaean) Greece was ruled by elites occupying massively walled citadels, their leaders buried surrounded by their weapons. But how did these warriors fight? Do the epic poems of Homer memorialize Bronze Age combat? In the Archaic Period (700-500 BCE) infantry warfare in Greece was transformed by the appearance of the heavily-armored infantryman (the hoplite), deployed in a tight formation (the phalanx). The processes involved in the appearance of this kind of warfare, its nature, and its affects on Greek society and culture will be the focus of our attention for the second third of the course. On the periphery of the Mediterranean basin stood a variety of warrior cultures (the Scythians, Celts, or Germans). Numerous warrior-dominated polities vied with each other in Archaic Italy, but one of them, sitting on a ford of the river Tiber, ultimately rose to be the greatest military power produced by the ancient Mediterranean world: Rome. The Roman legions first won and then ensured the security of a Mediterranean-wide empire that stood for 700 years and evolved ultimately into world's first standing army of professional volunteers. The Roman military system holds our attention for the final third of the course. The course defines warfare broadly to include both tactical and strategic, as well as cultural and ideological, matters. Even this canvas is too vast to be surveyed in all its richness, so the major themes explored are: (i) what is war, where does it come from, and how did it change as civilization spread?; (ii) in what ways did warfare develop in the periods under study, in terms of strategy, tactics, and weapons technology?; (iii) how do different warfare practices reflect essential facets of the various cultures under consideration?"
CAMS 197: Special Topics,"Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest."
CAMS 25U: Greek Civilization - Honors,"This course explores the cultural, political, and historical identity of the ancient Greeks-who they were, what they achieved, how they organized their society, and what they believed. This is not a history of ancient Greece, but an examination into the different facets of ancient Greek civilization, including the Trojan War myth, the ancient Olympics, the rise of democracy, slavery, the cultural and political contexts of artistic performance, and the sex-gender system. Students will pursue these topics and others using an interdisciplinary approach, consulting evidence from Greek literature, art, history, and philosophy. Ultimately, this course will provide students with a broad background in ancient Greek civilization and prepare them for more advanced work in the ancient Mediterranean world. While this course covers much of the same material as , this is an honors course. Students will be asked to do additional readings and to complete a research project at its conclusion. In addition, it fulfills both the GH and IL requirements."
CAMS 33: Roman Civilization,"CAMS 033 Roman Civilization (3) (GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Roman Civilization (CAMS 033) provides a comprehensive survey of an ancient society whose impact continues to be felt across a range of modern cultures in the twenty-first century. For more than a millennium, the Romans ruled an empire that eventually spanned three continents (Europe, North Africa, the Near and Middle East). Studying their culture can inform our own understanding of modern life both nationally and internationally. Many ideas in such diverse areas as government, law, military organization and strategy, the calendar, social practices, urban life, literature, art, and architecture clearly derive from Roman practices. Furthermore, study of the Romans includes learning in detail about the geography and resources of a very large area of the world. Knowledge of the Romans and the similarities and important differences between their lives and ours also provide an opportunity to reflect on human values and contemporary culture. The course includes discussion of the origin of the Romans, how they saw it themselves, and the rather different picture painted by modern archaeology. How the Romans expanded and maintained their power with long periods of peace from what is now southern Scotland to North Africa, and from Gibraltar to the borders of India, and how their power waned in the later Roman period illustrates many aspects of political institutional design. Roman society included various social groups, from slaves to the wealthy members of the traditional nobility. The opportunity for movement from slave to freedman or freedwoman to full citizen helps explain why for generations Roman rule was widely accepted. Roman urban life, with its public meeting halls, baths, arenas, race courses, theaters, luxurious houses and apartment blocks spread across Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. The most influential works of Rome's poets, such as Vergil's ""Aeneid"" and Ovid's ""Metamorphoses,"" remain rich sources for current writers, composers, and choreographers. Roman historians and thinkers also continue to inform and inspire. Religious beliefs and the causes for the growth of Christianity likewise remain relevant to the present."
CAMS 45H: Classical Mythology,"Classical Mythology (3) (GH)(H)(IL)(BA)  introduces the myths of ancient Greece and Rome as they are represented in the canonical works of Greek and Latin literature and art. Students become conversant in classical mythology by studying the stories of gods and goddesses and heroes and heroines. The course discusses the meaning and function of myths in their historical, religious, and literary contexts. It may also approach the interpretation of myth from different disciplinary perspectives (comparative mythology, critical theory, cultural anthropology, gender theory, history, philosophy, psychology, religion, or rhetoric). In addition,  gives students the opportunity to apply their knowledge and understanding of myth to the flourishing legacy of classical mythology in the literature, art, and culture of subsequent ages."
CAMS 472: Akkadian,"Introduction to the Akkadian language (Babylonian & Assyrian) and the cuneiform writing system.   Akkadian (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Akkadian is the cover term for the East Semitic dialects spoken and written in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the mid-third millennium b.c.e. to about the first century c.e. These dialects (Babylonian and Assyria) are all quite similar. As is customary, the course will focus on Old Babylonian, as this is the 'classical' variety of the language, and served as the basis for the dialect of the vast majority of later Akkadian texts (Standard Babylonian). This course aims to familiarize students with the basics of Akkadian grammar and enable them to read a wide variety of genres: legal texts, letters, omens, royal inscriptions, and literary compositions. Because of the specific nature of the writing system and the fact that many texts are available only in copies, students will also be introduced to the cuneiform script, its basic structure, and a basic repertoire of signs. Every meeting will follow a similar structure: the first part will be devoted to the exercises corresponding to the lesson in the textbook that was explained the previous day; and the second part will be an explanation of the next lesson, the exercises of which will have to be prepared for the next meeting. Students will be required to do all the assigned exercises in advance, and participate in class. Special emphasis will be put on class participation: every student will be asked to read and translate in class. Furthermore, occasional quizzes are by no means a remote possibility.

"CED 102N: Wicked Problems Like Inequality, Sustainability & Climate Change: What's the Right Thing to Do?","Many of the most pressing problems facing humankind, like inequality, sustainability & climate change, are known as Wicked Problems; they are complex with many interconnected components, are difficult to clarify or define, involve different stakeholders with very different views, and often are intertwined with other major problems. They require working within a social and ethical context because their resolution typically requires individual and institutional change, and they are relentless; Wicked Problems can't be solved ""once and for all."" It is easy to feel overwhelmed by such problems, as if little can be done. Yet there are ways to work proactively and effectively on such problems, 'living your solutions locally.' This discussion-based interdomain course explores how people are addressing Wicked Problems, examining the 'Right Thing to Do' from several dimensions, including (1) what is ethically appropriate to do in response to a Wicked Problem (and how perspectives on this vary); and (2) the social and behavioral means people use to address such problems. In the course students explore the complex nature of Wicked Problems, including how these are shaped by social, political, and other factors. The rules matter. Students then learn major concepts of justice which commonly are applied to such issues, how these views vary across people affected by the problem, and the importance of recognizing other peoples' perspectives. Students use case studies to explore and critique strategies for engaging Wicked Problems, and how these are used by people working to address these issues. Finally, students work together in small learning teams to analyze a Wicked Problem of their choice, including how various stakeholders view the problem and its potential solutions, and how practitioners are addressing the problem through social and behavior means."

For example, while the drive for flexible displays and solar cells is increasing, there is no clear pathway for efficient recycling of the resulting electronic polymeric materials. To this end, this course will engage students in discussions about industrial processing of polymers and the importance to find new pathways for their recycling."
CHEM 540: Biophysical Chemistry,"This three-credit course will cover the key theories and experimental methods of contemporary biophysics and biophysical chemistry. The course discusses the structures and dynamics of biomolecules (such as proteins, DNAs, and RNAs), the statistical mechanical models to describe the behaviors of biopolymers and the biophysical methods to analyze the structures of biopolymers in solution, the biophysical theories for protein folding/unfolding and the experimental methods to measure the kinetics of protein folding/unfolding and the protein structural dynamics, the principles of biomolecule structure determination by X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopes, as well as the theories to describe ligand binding to biological macromolecules (such as receptors, protein complexes, aptamers, etc.) and the experimental methods to measure ligand binding. For all the topics covered by this course, emphasis will be laid on both theoretical models and experimental methods will be discussed. Classic and modern biophysical and biochemical techniques ranging from spectroscopy and FRET to optical microscopy, including super-resolution and micromanipulation techniques, will be covered.

CHNS 403W: Level Four Chinese A,"Continuation of .  Aims to improve students' proficiency in all four language skills, with a special emphasis on writing.   Level Four Chinese A (4) This is a four credit course designed for those who have completed Level Three Chinese B or the equivalent. The course aims to further develop students' proficiency in all four language skills, with a special emphasis on writing. Students will study several topics on current social issues in modern Chinese society, such as education and housing issue, woman's status, through a selected textbook, news reading, and by interviewing native speaker of Chinese from different regions. Via all the debatable topics, students will be guided to explore and practice various writing styles, such as description, narration, argumentation, and expository writing throughout the semester. Comparison of rhetorical strategies between Chinese and English writing will also be introduced to help students think and write more like a native when using the target language. The majority of reading and writing assignments will be done outside of class, with some guidance from the instructor. Class time will be used mainly for discussions of content, feedback on writing. All class activities will be conducted in Chinese. Writing exercises include short response papers on topics, summarizes of the readings, and short essays. Through the writing exercises, students will reflect more deeply on certain topics, synthesize information from course materials, provoke critical thinking and express their opinions and support ideas by referring to and citing from source texts. This will help students be prepared for a longer thesis in the next course in the sequence. This course will help students further advance their writing skills by continuously building their vocabulary, understanding the target culture, and its social issues through various sources of structured and authentic materials. Students will also write a resume and formal letter that help them start building their career in Chinese."
CHNS 411: Chinese Written Characters,"This course aims to establish a solid foundation of students' Chinese orthography and prepare students for continuing study in subsequent Chinese courses.   Chinese Written Characters (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course aims to equip students' knowledge and skills of Chinese orthography through both cognitive and meta-cognitive approach of learning, where it is expected to lay a solid foundation for students' continuing study of subsequent Chinese language courses. Students will learn and apply radical and component-building approach to synthesize their already-acquired characters, and further learn approximately 500 additional characters. Characters selected for study in this course are based upon the references of HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) Level V and TOP-Huayu (Test of Proficiency- Huayu) Intermediate level. Building upon these characters, students will further expand their vocabulary volume through character association strategy and extensive reading. Cooperative learning approach will be largely incorporated to promote in-class active learning, such as developing and sharing character learning strategies through keeping learning journal, group reading, discussing cultural connotations of selected amount of characters, etc. Students will also learn the origin, history and evolution of Chinese characters through textbook reading and multimedia materials learning, such as DVD and You Tube video clips that help visualize the evolution process of selected characters for demonstration. Instructional Objectives (what the student is expected to learn; what skills s/he will develop): 1. Understand the origin, history and evolution of Chinese characters 2. Develop and apply strategies on learning Chinese characters 3. Familiarize with available resources that assist Chinese characters learning and memorizing 4. Strengthen and synthesize students' existing knowledge of Chinese orthography 5. Learn approximately 500 new characters 6. Expand vocabulary volume derived from the acquired characters 7. Expand reading experience by reading semi-authentic and authentic articles that are constituted of the acquired characters 8. Strengthen listening and speaking skills of the target language through intensive in-class discussions and lectures"
"CHNS 414: Chinese Language, Culture and Society","The study of Chinese language and culture and a perspective on the way of life in contemporary Chinese society. Through this course, the students are introduced to a cognitive approach to the study of Chinese language and culture and a broad perspective on the Chinese way of life in contemporary Chinese society. In particular, we will study how the interaction between Chinese language and culture frames the worldview of Chinese speakers, how the usage of the Chinese language manifests the underlying conceptual structure, which in turn is shaped by the physical (including bodily) and cultural experience of its speakers, and how conventional usage of linguistic expressions of Chinese reflects, and possibly influences, the ways in which Chinese speakers see or conceptualize the world. We will focus on conventionalized expressions, which include compound words, idiomatic phrases, and proverbial sayings, in the Chinese language, and study the Chinese conventional ways of talking about reality, both external and internal, as windows into Chinese culture and cognition. More generally, we will try to understand the embodied nature of human cognition as we see how abstract thought is grounded in bodily experience in and with the physical and cultural world. We will also look at various domains of life in contemporary China in order to gain a better understanding of Chinese society. The objectives of this course are threefold: (1) to lead Chinese language students to a linguistic approach to language analysis so that they learn about how individual linguistic expressions fit into a coherent linguistic system; (2) to enable them to see how linguistic structures reflect underlying cognitive, conceptual structures which are derived from the interplay between human embodiment and cultural environment; and (3) to provide them with a broad perspective on contemporary Chinese society."

"CI 387: Education, Culture, and Society in Brazil and Colombia","Given the increasing need to instill students with global perspectives, students from a range of backgrounds and academic majors will benefit from an in-depth exploration of the educational systems, cultures, and societies of Brazil and Colombia -- additionally, the course may also prepare students for (optional) summer travel to Brazil and/ or Colombia (provided they are interested in either of both of those opportunities). Students are invited to use their emerging understandings to reflect upon the U.S. educational system, its culture, and its society. Throughout the course, students will examine the structure of educational systems, educational policy, educational inequality across nations, education as a constitutional right, colonial histories, Dependency Theory, government corruption, urban and rural environments, labor issues, economics (i.e. Marxism, socialism, communism, inflation, currency devaluation, neoliberalism), politics, Colombia's ongoing civil war, and Brazilian culture (including music, beauty obsession, and sports). In addition, the course also provides a grounding in basic travel skills and basic Portuguese. Although the course's main emphasis is on education, students from a broad variety of backgrounds and educational interests are encouraged to enroll, since they are likely to find a broad array of topics that will increase their international acumen considerably."
CI 395: Internship,"Supervised off-campus, non-group instruction including field experiences, practica, or internships. Written and oral critique of activity required."
CI 515: Foundations of Educational Research,"Students read the philosophical foundations of education research, study how philosophies influence methodologies, and analyze current educational problems. This course is designed for students entering doctoral programs in the College of Education. Our students are studying to become education researchers within a highly politicized environment. For example, particular definitions of education research and government policies that favor some types of research practices over others provide opportunities for and set limits upon the work of education researchers. Public controversies likewise contribute to challenges faced by education researchers who find their work affirmed or discounted by particular definitions and policies. In order to explore these controversies and to allow students to begin identifying their own ""positionality"" with regard to research, this course begins with a reading of the history and philosophies of education research (primarily focusing on the United States). The course goals are: -     to identify underlying assumptions of competing forms of social inquiry, each determined to uncover new knowledge; -     to bring those assumptions to bear on education research in chosen fields of study; and -     to begin to develop one's own positions in order to direct further study and research. Specifically, through instructor facilitation and group discussions, students will come to understand major philosophical perspectives that permeate and drive research methodologies in education: positivism, postpositivism, interpretivism, critical theory, poststructuralism, and pragmatism. These understandings allow students to recognize the methodological assumptions that inform published research studies and to discover how methodologies might inform the research they wish to conduct as students and practitioners. Although the course is not required by any particular doctoral program in the College of Education, it is suggested for students who consider research important to their future careers and who see benefits in exploring the methodological options available."
CI 530: Identities in Second Language Learning,"This course investigates the ongoing collaborative construction and negotiation of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual, and social class identities in second language learning (SLL). It examines how we learn to speak our multiple selves in a new language, for example, how we learn to language race according to our prior background and the cultural practices and understandings of second language contexts. The impact of these social identities and polemics of racism, sexism, xenophobia, colonialism, homophobia, and elitism that arise when we study them are not restricted to experiences outside the classroom, nor can they be divorced from language curriculum and pedagogy. Examining such issues in SLL can be challenging due to the belief that raising them courts controversy unnecessarily and goes against mindsets that many value, such as colorblindness, because language learning is an area that naturally welcomes and fosters integration and interaction between different groups in multicultural education. Course participants will interrogate the idea of colorblind language learning classrooms and curricula and examine how the realities of language learners' differentiated, inequitable access, treatment, and experiences in multilingual contexts challenge the field's declared values of multiculturalism in education."
CI 541: Place(s) in Education,"In an essay about place, the anthropologist Clifford Geertz notes that ""something that is a dimension of everyone's existence, the intensity of where we are, passes by anonymously and unremarked. It goes without saying."" The purpose of this course is to foreground the concept of place and real places in our daily lives and academic work, particularly with respect to education (including schooling), to make sure that it does not go without saying. What is (a) place? How is it formed, bounded, made meaningful? How is it personal and social? What are its relationships with time and space? What are its relationships with experience, culture, citizenship, margins, diversity, and so many other topics? How does it shape living, especially learning and teaching in schools, and how is it shaped by these things? How do I and we fit in? And, following the feminist educational philosopher Nel Noddings, ""should schools teach for an understanding and love of place or should they now offer curricula designed to transcend place?"" Through a seminar format focused specifically on educational contexts, we will study place from a range of interdisciplinary perspectives and consider what these landscapes of place mean for teaching, learning, and educational research. Readings will draw from the fields of anthropology, art/s, curriculum, ecology, geography, indigenous thought, literature, philosophy, and sociology, all intersecting with education. Assignments will include citizenship in the community of this course, personal reflection about lived place(s) inside of schools and out, critical analyses of the literature on the intersections of education and place(s), and a final project focused on one aspect of how education and place(s) intersect that is of particular interest to the student. In dialogue, collaboration, the reading of each other's writings, and other activities such as a walking tour of students' most-meaningful places on campus, participants in this course will be and become citizens of the place (and its many physical, digital, and relational places) of the course. Students will exit the course with a broad understanding of the complexity of place(s) in education, including in the work of teachers and researchers."
CI 542: Girls' Cultures and Popular Cultures,"This seminar explores educational implications in popular texts created for and by girls across time and cultures. CI (WMNST) 542 Girls' Cultures and Popular Cultures (3) The study of girls and their relationship with popular culture lies within the interdisciplinary field of Girlhood Studies which draws on established areas of Women's Studies, Children's/Childhood studies, Cultural Studies and Educational Studies. This seminar explores girls cultures in different textual and material forms including books, toys, magazines, and new media. Students will employ feminist cultural theories to compare historical and contemporary girls cultures in relation to educational research and practice. This will provide a framework to locate girls at the center of research and action in order for graduate students to engage in methodologies that are not simply about girls but ""for"" ""with"" and ""by"" girls. Key topics include the misperception of girls (popular) culture as only a contemporary phenomenon, the role of girls as consumers plus producers of culture, and recurrent issues in girls cultures such as sexualization and hyperfeminity."
CI 560: Theories of Childhood,"The study of childhood from cultural, historical, psychological and philosophical perspectives.  Theories of Childhood (3) In this course, participants will explore the highly variable ways that childhood has been constructed and enacted across multiple cultures and throughout history. Participants will begin by considering how notions of the nature of childhood, for example, children as innocent, as primitive, or as blank slates have functioned across history and in their memories and sense of nostalgia about childhood. Participants will expand their understanding of historic and contemporary childhoods through comparative studies of children. Participants will examine and critique normative theories of child development and will finish with an examination of contemporary child culture, including play and how changes in global culture affect children's lives. The course instructor will provide the readings for the course, as well as background information and organizing topics. The instructor creates and assigns activities and provides or oversees discussion questions to organize student thinking for a productive discussion. It is the instructor's responsibility to create an environment conducive to students' development of an open, vibrant learning community; to establish and oversee course standards; and to assist students to achieve both the course objectives and their own. There are no prerequisites for this course. Given that all participants have had a childhood and some may be parents, the memories and experiences each participant brings may be both a help and a hindrance. That is, insofar as their own childhoods or those of their children cause them to believe that they already know what childhood is, class participants need to recognize the limitations of their memories and experiences. The diversity of childhoods that will be represented across the members of the course is a considerable resource for participants to develop an ever-broader understanding of the cultural and historical nature of childhood."

CMLIT 100: Reading Across Cultures,"Reading Across Cultures, is an introductory course to the discipline of Comparative Literature. The course is generally based upon a central theme (or series of themes) around which the reading assignments are chosen. Through a range of traditional (poems, short stories, drama, novellas, novels) and non-traditional (film, multimedia, hypermedia) texts from around the world, students will develop the ability to analyze literature in a variety of ways. Students will examine works both within their individual and diverse cultural contexts, and in relation to broader themes that transcend the boundaries of time and place. As an introductory course,  is intended to lay a solid foundation for further study in any college-level courses on cultures and/or literature. Through an examination of a wide range of world literature, we will explore the practical aspects of what it means to deal with literary works in a comparative global context. The course is intended to help you develop your analytical and comparative skills and to simultaneously introduce you to a wide variety of interesting world literatures."
CMLIT 105: The Development of Literary Humor,"Literary humor expressed as satire, comedy, and farce--from ancient times to the present--in an international and multicultural context.  The Development of Literary Humor (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.  is a broadly international course dealing with the nature of comedy and humor in literature. You will read samples from a broad spectrum of humor, including comedy, wit, satire, parody, irony, and farce. Through discussion and writing, you will also examine the techniques through which humor criticizes human nature, analyzes society, and expresses differing world views. The syllabus may be represented chronologically or divided into topics or literary forms that suggest various emphases, functions, and objects of literary humor. This course will provide opportunity to discuss both the widespread, or even universal, aspects of literary humor, and the diversity of literary humor across cultures and time periods. At the conclusion of this course, you should be able to understand and compare various literary forms and social, political, and cultural contexts that define humor and to assess the extent to which literary humor is or is not translatable across cultures or ethnic communities, or other groups. This course fulfills requirements for the Comparative Literature major, the World Literature minor, General Education Humanities, Bachelor of Arts Humanities, and General Education International/Intercultural Competency."
"CMLIT 107: Exploration, Travel, Migration, and Exile","The Literature of Exploration, Travel, Migration, and Exile (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.   compares the literatures of travel, migration, exploration, and exile from ancient times to the future, from narratives of journeys actually experienced through narratives of journeys imagined in the mind. The notion of the journey is broadly defined as encompassing both literal and metaphorical experiences, including travel journals and diaries, epic adventures, quests of introspection, dreams and visions, and depictions of the future. Through reading, discussion, and writing, you will examine and compare the different roles that travel can play in the imaginations of both the individual writers and the cultures from which they come. You will not only explore recurrent themes and timeless topics, but also the ways in which travel writing can both reinforce and subvert the basic value-systems, stereotypes, or other assumptions present in its cultural context. For many writers, traveling elsewhere is a means of evaluating their own societies, as well as a means of recording their responses to encountering real or imagined new places. The journeys of this course, which vary greatly from each other, will also allow you to consider some of the vast unknowns of the individual human mind and imagination. By traveling through this course, you will have the opportunity to develop the analytic reading, thinking, and writing skills necessary for the understanding of a variety of literatures and cultures, as well as the exploration of your own identity as an individual. This course fulfills requirements for the Comparative Literature major, the World Literature minor, General Education Humanities, Bachelor of Arts Humanities, and General Education International/Intercultural Competency."

You will gain an understanding of different national literatures and cultures, as well as knowledge of the historical, philosophical, and political contexts that produced them. Ideas such as ""the other,"" gender, and Orientalism will also be included in discussions of the texts.  is one of the many choices of survey courses which count towards the Comparative Literature major and the World Literature minor. This course also fulfills the General Education Humanities requirement, the Bachelor of Arts Humanities requirement, and International Cultures requirement."
CMLIT 140: Literature and the Other Arts: International and Comparative Perspectives,"A comparative, international examination of the relationship between literature and non-literary art forms.  Literature and the Other Arts: International and Comparative Perspectives (3) (GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. All around the world, literature and other forms of creative expression are related in many fascinating ways. Writers and artists often find inspiration from each other, and some artists work across a wide spectrum of genres and embody several identities at once. In different times and places, how have writers and artists reacted to critical events or lifecycle experiences? What techniques have writers, artists, composers, and choreographers shared? In examining a broadly international range of materials, in this course we will consider (1) how artists and writers depict common themes such as nature, death, aging, love, and more; (2) ways in which art and literature relate to each other; and (3) how literature and other arts are influenced by, and in turn exert influences upon, their cultural and social contexts. Using a global perspective, we will examine relationships between literature and a variety of artistic forms, such as painting, photography, comics, film, theatre, opera, music, sculpture, and more. Students will practice enabling skills for reading across genres, media, and cultures, and for expanding their skills in analyzing and synthesizing information, their awareness of a wide variety of value systems and cultural traditions in different times and places, and their horizons of literature in global contexts."
CMLIT 143: Human Rights and World Literature,"Human rights violations discussed in tandem with their literary representation, presented in a global and comparative context.  Human Rights and World Literature (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. ""Human rights"" refers to basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled, often held to include the right to life and liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and equality before the law. But these ideas have not always been a part of human thought and some scholars believe that without certain forms of literature today's understanding of human rights would not exist. Through comparative analysis of a variety of human rights storytelling genres that reflect a range of contexts, this course will suggest that it is impossible to understand human rights without also thinking about the stories that create and sustain their idea. One main premise of this course is that the representation of human rights violations is always a vexed undertaking. It is both urgent and necessary, while also incomplete and inadequate. In order to explore this dilemma, this course focuses on the intersection between human rights advocacy and the various cultural forms that explicitly attempt to participate in human rights discourse. The course will cover a variety of cultural forms such as comic books, movies, photography, novels, testimonials, poetry, plays, etc. that reflect on human rights atrocities such as slavery, the Holocaust, war, dictatorships, apartheid, genocide, and more. At the center of the course are questions about aesthetics and ethics. What are the risks and obligations of human rights storytelling and how are these linked to specific cultural forms and aesthetic practices? This course examines a range of human rights stories through a balance of context and close reading, where stories are studied both for what they say and how they say it."
CMLIT 184: The Short Story,"This course is designed to introduce students to the art of the short story and to acquaint them with some of its most talented writers. During the semester we will read short stories from various cultures and countries, ranging from stories written in the early nineteenth-century to those written within the last few years. Readings will include works from authors like Hawthorne, Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Bierce, Chekhov, Kafka, Chopin, Crane, Gilman, James, Cather, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Hemingway, Lawrence, Orwell, O'Connor, Baldwin, Olson, Silko, Erdrich, Ondaatje, Barth, Barthelme, Atwood, Mukherjee, Walker, Tan, Calvino, Garcia Marquez, and Cortazar. All readings will be in English. This course is intended to help one learn how to read fiction, how to understand it, and how to talk about it. The desire to tell stories and to be told stories is one of the most basic human needs, and all cultures have been defined in part by the stories they hear and the stories they tell. We are not born knowing how to read the short story or any fiction for that matter. Rather it is a skill that one acquires, and the more one does it, like playing tennis or any other activity, the better one becomes at it, for we learn what to look for. We will explore the historical development of the short story genre, and examine how historical contexts relate to the content and style of the stories under discussion. We will become familiar with how stories are put together and with the vocabulary that is used to discuss fiction--terms such as plot, narrative, character, tone, language, closure, irony, imagery. and so forth. CMLIT/ is not required for the CmLit major but may be selected to fulfill one of the course requirements for the major or the World Literature Minor.

This course is designed to act as a gateway to Asian literatures and cultures - through English translation - of selected fictional and cinematic texts from Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Asian diaspora literature (our main focus is on literature of modern Asia). Exploring the historical and cultural contexts of each work, we will pay attention to the ways in which each text depicts the diversities within geographical areas (for instance, ""Japanese culture"" is not monolithic than ""U.S. Culture"" is, and writers might see the same social reality in quite differently). The cross/inter-cultural approach used in this course invites students to acquire a global perspective on the rich traditions of Asian cultures and literatures.

CRIM 201: Presumed Innocent? Social Science of Wrongful Conviction,"The criminal justice system is a human creation and some errors are expected. Sometimes guilty parties go free and sometimes innocent people are convicted. In this course, we will employ the perspective of the social scientist to understand why and how wrongful convictions occur. How can social science help to predict, explain, and prevent wrongful convictions? This course is organized into three units. In the first unit, we will examine the large body of social science research that demonstrates disparities in all stages of the criminal justice system. For example, young Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. This is partly due to these men disproportionately living in environments that foster crime, but social science research shows sometimes it's also partly due to the discretionary decisions of police, prosecutors, and courts. As a result, these demographic groups are most likely to be wrongfully convicted. In the second unit, we'll explore the factors in the justice system that might lead to a wrongful conviction, including false confessions, eyewitness misidentification, poor legal representation, government misconduct, and informants and snitches. Social scientific findings elucidate how each of these factors influence conviction accuracy. Finally, we'll discuss how social science research on the risks and factors that contribute to wrongful convictions can be used to improve policies to reduce the risk of such convictions. Simple reforms such as openness about plea-bargaining, eyewitness identification reform (e.g., sequential lineups, double-blind procedures, etc.), recording of interrogations, and introducing Innocence Commissions in every state can improve our criminal justice system."
CRIM 225N: Organized Crime in Film and Society,"/ , Organized Crime in Film & Society, examines the relationship between criminological and justice theories regarding organized crime and the portrayal of the mafia in popular Italian American film.

And probably most important, to educate students so that they will not unintentionally destroy physical evidence at a crime scene, and will in fact try to preserve it for the trained forensic scientist. The experiments are designed to provide students with an overview of what can be done as a prelude to making them potential professional forensic scientists/criminologists. The proposed courses are meant for students majoring in the Administration of Justice Programs and should augment their knowledge of criminology and reinforce approaches utilized by law enforcement scientists. Students will carry out hands on experiments in biology, chemistry and physics in a dedicated laboratory setting. Use of instrument to analyze specimens and gather/interpret data using computers and statistical techniques form part of the course. Students will be graded based on their understanding of the principles involved in selecting and using specific laboratory techniques and on the quality of results of their laboratory experience. It is anticipated that the course will be offered once a year, first part during fall semester and the second part during the following semester.

This course examines drug use in a historical context while addressing the changing nature and dimension of drug use, including the pharmacology of drugs, patterns of drug use, and sentencing policies. Because drug control is inextricably linked to social, political, and public policy, the course will provide the student with a foundation for critical thinking and rational decision making relative to the efficacy of the various drug control initiatives. Since drugs seemingly permeate every level of American society and directly or tangentially touch most Americans' lives, issues such as drug testing in the workplace, the use of drug courier profiles, legalized medical marijuana, and needle exchange programs are evaluated. Students will be expected to learn the pharmacology of various drugs, the history of drug use in the United States since the colonial era, the evolution of federal drug agencies, and acquire knowledge about contemporary drug issues. They also will be expected to develop and strengthen their critical thinking skills as they assess the consequences of implementing particular anti-drug policies and their impact on reducing the use of illicit drug use. An example of the evaluation methods would be: students will be evaluated on the basis of three exams and four ""think pieces"" (requiring students' critical responses to an assigned topic) scheduled throughout the semester. Class attendance also will influence the grade. Faculty Member Proposing Course : John C. McWilliams"

Earthquakes are natural phenomena that can cause immense human suffering because of intense ground shaking, and are consequently of great societal importance. Earthquakes are also important because the seismic waves that generate the ground shaking provide scientists with important information about Plate Tectonics and geology, in particular information about the structure and composition of our planet and how the insides of the planet are deforming. In this course, earthquakes in Africa and the seismic waves they generate are used to help students to learn about the geology of Africa and how the earth beneath the African continent is being deformed by Plate Tectonics. is designed in four modules. Modules, in turn, are divided into weekly lessons. Offered in a 'hybrid' format, each weekly lesson includes a single face-to-face class meeting, complemented by online reading assignments, self-check learning activities, and discussions. The online, hands-on learning activities are similar to the labs conducted in similar courses that are offered solely in face-to-face environment, including the manipulation of geographic data, map reading exercises, and rock and mineral identification activities. They are designed to help students learn skills and knowledge that they then apply to a course project. While the weekly lesson activities involve working with seismic data from East Africa, the course project requires students, working in small groups, to apply their skills and knowledge to another geographic area of the African continent. In addition to the weekly lesson activities and the course project, students are required to complete weekly quizzes that assess comprehension of the online reading assignments.

Coral Reef Systems (4) (GN) The course introduces students to coral reef environments, past and present. It describes the processes that control the distribution, growth, and morphology of reefs and introduces students to the complexity of the coral reef ecosystem. The course emphasizes the role that reefs play in the natural environment and examines their importance to society both globally (e.g. in terms of biodiversity and its potential benefits) and locally in terms of, for example, food supply and tourism. We then look at the natural disturbances (such as disease, storms, sea surface temperature variations) that affect the reef, as well as ways in which reefs are threatened from human impacts, with an emphasis on global climate change and the long-term outlook for reef survival. Students will work in groups to research elements of the system, first at a global scale, and then focusing specifically on one region -- the Bahamas platform. Students will look at the history of the Bahamas platform and its relationship to the present nature and distribution of coral reefs. They will then examine these in the context of their social, cultural, and economic importance to local communities. A third component of the course will concentrate on the identification of vertebrate and invertebrate species and substrate conditions that are important indicators of reef health. There will then be a one-week field trip to a coral reef system to conduct reef surveys. The surveys follow the Reef Check protocol (a volunteer, community-based monitoring protocol designed to measure the health of coral reefs on a global scale). Reef Check is administered out of the University of California at Los Angeles. The coral reef surveys will be conducted on scuba and the field trip and participation in the survey are required elements of the course. Students who are not scuba certified will be given the opportunity to obtain open water scuba certification as part of the course, through Penn State&rsquo;s Science Diving Program (The PSU Science Diving Program is a member of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences).

ECON 106H: Statistical Foundations for Econometrics (Honors),"Statistical Foundations for Econometrics Honors (ECON106H) teaches basic statistical concepts used in economics, specifically in the area of econometrics. Econometrics is a field of economics where quantitative methods are used to study economic data. Topics studied in this course include probability distributions, expectations, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and simple regression. Since probability and statistics is a mathematical subject, it is nearly impossible to study it without using mathematical tools such as sets and functions. Therefore, students are expected to be comfortable with, or at the minimum open to, using algebra and mathematical arguments. Some concepts from calculus (e.g. derivatives and integrals) are important to understand continuous probability distributions such as the famous normal distribution. Therefore, the course will spend some time reviewing important concepts and results from calculus as needed. Students will also learn and other probability distributions and density functions, and be able to apply them in practice. Students will use computer programs to model randomized experiments and run regressions on datasets for analysis. Interpreting the findings of the regressions are key to understanding what the data shows, and depending on the data, the results may also have important policy implications. ECON106 is a required course for all majors in economics. This honors version of the course is designed to provide the opportunity to pursue this course at a more in-depth and mathematically rigorous level.

Introduction to Econometrics (3) In this course students learn basic quantitative methods used in applied economics, focusing on linear regression models and their applications. The course will cover topics similar to those covered in  but with more mathematical rigor (i.e., using calculus). Following an introduction and reviews of probability and statistics, the course will focus on: (1) the statistical properties of commonly-used estimators and test statistics in regression models, (2) how to use them in practice for statistical inference, and (3) the issue of endogeneity and instrumental variables. Students will study both practical and theoretical aspects of econometrics, by which they will be able to implement the basic methods in practice and to understand the limitations of these methods. This course is an honors version of the second quantitative course in economics that is now required of all economics majors. As noted above, students will learn both theoretical and practical aspects of econometrics, so that they will be able to carry out econometric analyses of data. Evaluation of student performance will be based on homework assignments, midterm exams, and a final exam. Typically, the homework assignments would account for 20 percent of the overall course grade, each of two midterm exams would count for 25 percent of the grade, and the final exam would count for the remaining 30 percent of the grade.

ECON 407W: Political Economy,"Applications of the tools of game theory to analyze topics in collective decision making.  Political Economy (3) The course covers two main topics. First, the course will analyze elections as a mechanism to aggregate preferences of the electorate. It will be shown that elections provide a good tool to strike a compromise between all members of the electorate if the scope of disagreement in the electorate is one-dimensional. A simple model of taxation in which citizens' preferences over tax rates are ""one-dimensional"" in the above sense will be developed. This model will be used to predict how tax rates in democratic countries change with the income distribution. It will be shown next that no satisfaction mechanism of preference aggregation exists in a slightly more general model of taxation. This result is a special case of the famous Impossibility Theorem by Arrow.Secondly, conditions will be given under which elections are a good mechanism to aggregate information that is spread throughout the electorate. It turns out that theories of information aggregation yield a convincing theory about abstention. A model in which the less informed voters delegate the decision to the more informed voters by simply abstaining will be discussed. The discussion of political debates and the media will be framed in terms of an information aggregation model. Finally, the potential of information aggregation theories to explain social movements will be discussed.Game theory provides a framework to think about many issues in the social sciences. This particular course focuses on some applications of game theory to politics. The first, and very specific goal, is to use the lens of game theory to understand the workings of various political institutions. The second, more general, goal is to enable students to apply game-theoretic reasoning to a wide range of topics in the social sciences. The third is to make the research frontier in the field of political economy as accessible as possible. It is hoped that students would get a better understanding of what graduate school would be like.This course has as its broad objective to expose students to the use of the tools of game theory to analyze collective decision making. Students will learn how to use economic theory to analyze real-world situations of collective decision making. They will develop their analytical skills as well as their skills in writing in economics.The writing-intensive course is one of a series of 400-level writing intensive seminars that the Economics Department is offering to its advanced undergraduates in seven different area of economics. This seminar is in the area of microeconomic theory.The course will count toward the major and the minor in economics as a 400-level course. Further, it will count toward completion of a module (specialization) in the area of theory and quantitative methods."
ECON 408W: Intellectual Property,"A comparative and cost-benefit analysis of intellectual property that examines patents, copyrights, government supported research, and prizes.   Intellectual Property (3)We live in a society that has a decentralized system based on the institutions of private property and trade. In such a system, things belong to people and can be transferred by their owners to other people. An exchange that moves something to someone who values it more than its present owner produces a net benefit, which may be shared between the parties to the exchange. Thus such a system tends to move everything to those who most value it, producing an efficient allocation of goods and services. The logic and limitations of this process make up the branch of economics called price theory. The course undertakes an examination of intellectual property, a subfield of property rights. In the context of intellectual property, there are five specific areas of note: patent races, poorly constructed incentives, standards, licenses, and an examination of costs. There are three factors relevant to the costs of providing legal protection to some particular sort of intellectual property. One is how easy it is to define and defend property in that sort of idea. Another is the degree in which someone who creates and claims ownership in that particular sort of intellectual property reduces, by so doing, the options available to other people. The more serious these problems are, the less the gains from defining and enforcing property rights in ideas. Where they are sufficiently serious, we are better off with an intellectual commons--a legal regime in which certain classes of ideas are free for all to use than with intellectual property. These three costs must be balanced against the benefits--production of more and better intellectual property and better coordination of intellectual property once produced. The larger these benefits are likely to be, the greater the costs we are willing to bear in order to get them. The course objectives are to apply the framework of comparative and cost-benefit analysis to the study of intellectual property. The course will examine the empirical evidence, and also consider policy issues in this area."

More precisely, the course will focus on economic theories of discrimination and on efforts by economists to measure the extent of labor market discrimination. An important objective of the course is thus to learn how economists conceptualize and study discrimination. This, in turn, requires that we examine how economists view and study economic differences by race, ethnicity, and gender (these are the types of discrimination that will be focused on in the course, although we will also consider other types of discrimination). Following the existing economic literature, much of our emphasis will be on labor market discrimination, but we will also consider discrimination in education and in housing. The first substantive section of the course outline below involves examination of data on the economic characteristics of women and blacks in relation to white males, considering both the current situation and recent trends. Data on Hispanics will also be presented. This work will be done by the students, working in groups. We will look at how mainstream economists conceptualize economic differences by gender and by race/ethnicity, respectively. Then we will focus on formal models of discrimination and empirical issues in attempting to measure discrimination, and we'll also examine an alternative approach to understanding economic inequality. The concluding section of the course will examine public policy issues related to discrimination. The course will count toward either a major or a minor in economics, and will meet the writing requirement for students in economics."

EET 410: Power System Analysis II,"Power System Analysis II follows up the material from Power System Analysis I with more details on the analysis and calculation during faults or transients. Students will understand symmetrical faults such as three-phase and single-phase short circuits. Next, symmetrical components in power system will be introduced and impedance loads, series impedances, three-phase transmission lines, rotating machines, and transformers will be modeled. This course (Power System Analysis II) helps students to understand unsymmetrical faults such as single line to ground, double line to ground, and line to line faults. Furthermore, students will understand how to analyze the power system components under different fault conditions. Protection and relaying play an important role in a power system. Having equipment such as generators or transformers in power grids, engineers and power system planners should protect these expensive devices from faults or any transients. Relays and breakers are the best tools for protection. Relays sense the currents/voltages in multiple locations. If the measured current/voltage is not within the limit, they send the command to the breakers to disconnect the circuit and protect the equipment. Students in Power System Analysis II will analyze the protection devices and operation principles of relays. The last topic in this course is the transient stability of synchronous machines using equivalent dynamic model and generator control. This course will help students to model the generators in power systems and apply various control mechanisms such as: voltage, frequency, or power control to the synchronous generator model."

Students will also actively explore the ways in which the Bible has shaped the literature of English-speaking cultures around the world. Students will read substantial portions of the Old and New Testaments, learning to read critically and to interpret the Bible as they would any other literary text. They will also learn about the historical construction of the Bible, some history of its translation, and contemplate the competing versions of existing Biblical texts. Accordingly, reading the Bible as literature by necessity requires critical engagement with different international cultures from different historical periods."
ENGL 105: American Popular Culture and Folklife,"/  offers a survey of popular culture and folklife in America's past and present. The course synthesizes a broad scope of materials from areas such as literature, movies, television, sports, amusement parks, music, media, and advertising. While selected topics for readings, lectures, and discussion vary from class to class, all courses focus on a critical examination of a variety of popular and folk cultures in order to produce an enriched understanding of America, its past, its diverse cultures, its evolving values and traditions, and its inhabitants. To meet this goal, popular and folk cultures will be examined from a variety of perspectives, including race, gender, and class.  may be taken by students pursuing the American Studies major; for them, the course provides preparation for more advanced courses in American folklore, American literature, and American cultural history. Non-American Studies students may use this course to fulfill the general education requirement (GH). Students will receive the US designation for this course, and it meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements."
ENGL 130: Reading Popular Texts,"READING POPULAR TEXTS explores a variety of popular texts across various media with the goal of enabling students to sharpen their ability to interpret the social, political, and cultural significance of such texts in the contemporary world. Since these texts are primarily examples of popular culture-pervasive, selfreplicating, commercialized artifacts of the contemporary scene-they are familiar to the general student outside the classroom. Too often, however, students have not seen such texts subjected to the same kind of critical readings more elite cultural forms (e.g., canonized literature, art, and music). The purpose of the course is fulfilled if such students come away from it with a sharpened awareness of the role that pupular texts play in their daily lives and the means to discuss and explain their influence-in short, to read their culture more crirically."
ENGL 138T: Rhetoric and Civic Life II,"This course builds rhetorical skills in oral, written, visual, and digital contexts and introduces deliberation and advocacy in civic and disciplinary spheres. CAS (ENGL) 138T Rhetoric and Civic Life II (3) (GWS)ENGL/, Rhetoric and Civic Life II, expands knowledge and aptitudes built in ENGL/ by asking students to use rhetorical skills and principles to develop strategies for persuasion and advocacy in the context of civic issues. The course continues the multimodal emphasis-the focus on oral, written, visual, and digital communication-used in 137H and adds new components as well. Students will develop a repertoire of communication skills through hands-on practice at composing and delivering speeches and essays, and they will work with digital media to create multimedia texts, podcasts, and websites. Students will reflect on these different modes as themselves rhetorical choices. The course's civic and ethical components take center stage as students learn how to deliberate important public issues thoughtfully and with civility and respect. They will learn the difference between persuasion and advocacy and develop strategies for both in the context of pertinent local, national, and global issues. They will participate in a public deliberation forum on topics they generate and vote on. The forum will be organized to allow small deliberative action groups as well as large forum-style meetings. The course focuses on ethics in many contexts, e.g., community action and public deliberation; ethics of persuasion; ethical controversies in the disciplines. Students will be encouraged to explore percolating disciplinary interests and to share knowledge in online disciplinary communities. Students will work throughout the semester to design and build a final electronic portfolio that represents their academic work with an eye to their imagined professional futures. The portfolio assignment offers students an opportunity to reflect on their work, assessing the merits and themes of inquiries, and to curate and present their work to both targeted and broad online audiences."
ENGL 139: African American Literature,"This course offers an introduction to African American literature from the early writings of slavery and freedom to the works of present-day African American authors. We will explore the major themes, literary traditions and narrative strategies that merge and shape this body of literature, considering, for example, the influence of double-consciousness, questions of authenticity and performance, representations of blackness and whiteness, the significance of place, and the persistent presence of folklore and vernacular traditions. Our analyses of texts will be attentive to the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality, and by the end of the course you will be able to discuss fluently several literary techniques and strategies including irony, satire, narration, voice, characterization, imagery, style and setting. We will situate texts in their various historical and cultural contexts, and you will be introduced to key literary concepts and terms that should inform your reading and writing about these texts. You will learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts and write persuasively about literary works. Students will engage in thoughtful, creative and open-minded class discussions, analyze literature and do close and careful readings of texts."
ENGL 141N: African American Read-In Engaged Learning Experience,"This course will allow students to study African American literature, culture, history, and arts in connection with an annual public event, the African American Read-In (AARI). The AARI, promoting literacy and appreciation of African American literature, is a national event established in 1990 under the auspices of the National Council of Teachers of English. It has become a regular feature of Black History Month celebrated by community, neighborhood, and church groups as well as schools and institutions of higher education throughout the United States and elsewhere on a given Sunday and Monday in February attracting more than a million participants annually. This course offers students an engaged learning experience in which they will produce original intellectual and artistic content to be presented publicly at an AARI event on campus. Students will study texts from a range of historical periods and/or genres, and thus gain a solid introduction to the African American literary tradition. At the same time, the primary organizing principle of the course will be a particular theme that both allows a broad and coherent overview of a significant cultural or historical topic and engages issues of cultural diversity in the United States. The specific theme, thus, will bring the study of African American literature into a broader interdisciplinary context that intersects with African American culture, history, identity, and the struggle for equality. Students will study texts that relate to this annual theme and participate in a relevant field trip (museum, theater, cultural site, library, etc.) to deepen their understanding of the significance and contexts, social, historical, cultural, artistic of these materials and this theme. They will then develop this knowledge through creative and critical engagements into exhibitions, presentations, or performances to communicate their insights about a particular author, text, or topic in in the African American literary tradition. As shapers of the AARI program on their campus, class members will also have a voice in designing and planning the AARI as well as a stake in its overall success. As this course necessarily spans semesters, students who enroll in the Fall course will be expected to enroll in the Spring course in order to present their projects at the AARI in February. Only students who were enrolled in the Fall course will be permitted to enroll in the Spring, as it is the culmination of the same course."
ENGL 144: Everyday Rhetoric,"This course provides a general introduction to the practices and traditions of rhetoric, as well as its presence and use in daily life. How do speakers and writers use language to move audiences in strategic ways? How have different forms of technology facilitated or limited different modes of persuasion? Additional topics include the consideration of different rhetorical situations, the study of the enduring influence of established rhetorical traditions and devices, and the rhetorical analysis of current popular texts and media (written, aural, visual, digital)."
ENGL 15E: Rhetoric and Composition Enhanced,"Enhanced prepares students to understand the functions of and produce a variety of texts for public and academic audiences. Class size is limited to 18 (as opposed to the regular 24) and provides individualized instruction, regular engagement with peers, and weekly online tutorials. The combination of these resources helps familiarize students with conventional genres and practices of usage and style written discourse. The course is cohort-based and paced, which means that there is an established start and end date, and that students will have weekly deadlines to meet throughout the term."
ENGL 184: The Short Story,"This course is designed to introduce students to the art of the short story and to acquaint them with some of its most talented writers. During the semester we will read short stories from various cultures and countries, ranging from stories written in the early nineteenth-century to those written within the last few years. Readings will include works from authors like Hawthorne, Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Bierce, Chekhov, Kafka, Chopin, Crane, Gilman, James, Cather, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Hemingway, Lawrence, Orwell, O'Connor, Baldwin, Olson, Silko, Erdrich, Ondaatje, Barth, Barthelme, Atwood, Mukherjee, Walker, Tan, Calvino, Garcia Marquez, and Cortazar. All readings will be in English. This course is intended to help one learn how to read fiction, how to understand it, and how to talk about it. The desire to tell stories and to be told stories is one of the most basic human needs, and all cultures have been defined in part by the stories they hear and the stories they tell. We are not born knowing how to read the short story or any fiction for that matter. Rather it is a skill that one acquires, and the more one does it, like playing tennis or any other activity, the better one becomes at it, for we learn what to look for. We will explore the historical development of the short story genre, and examine how historical contexts relate to the content and style of the stories under discussion. We will become familiar with how stories are put together and with the vocabulary that is used to discuss fiction--terms such as plot, narrative, character, tone, language, closure, irony, imagery. and so forth. CMLIT/ is not required for the CmLit major but may be selected to fulfill one of the course requirements for the major or the World Literature Minor. This course also fulfills the General Education Humanities requirement, the Bachelor of Arts Humanities requirement, and International Cultures requirement."
ENGL 190Q: Medievalism,"In English 190Q /  students will gain an understanding of medievalism, defined by Leslie J. Workman in 1987 as ""the study of the Middle Ages, the application of medieval models to contemporary needs, and the inspiration of the Middle Ages in all forms of art and thought."" As this definition suggests, understanding medievalism and, thus, the popular works students know, such as Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings' benefit from learning something about the Middle Ages and the reach of its re-mediation across various kinds of expression. Therefore,  /  begins by introducing students to medieval works and a few of the forms that characterize it. More particularly, the medieval works to be studied are those combining more than one genre, media, and/or form. For example, students will read and listen to (or sing!) medieval lyrics, read and perform short medieval plays such as Robin Hood, be introduced to manuscripts of the bestiary with its illuminations, historiated letters, and scribal copying. They also will be introduced to Romanesque and Gothic architecture The first medievalist remediations--works adapted in other media--to be examined will be Book I of Spenser's Faerie Queene, with the woodcut of the Redcrosse Knight and Dryden/Purcell's King Arthur, which will introduce students to Early Modern English medievalism and how it reflects prevailing values in new combinations of old and new artistic forms. Still greater emphasis will be placed on the English Medieval Revival of the nineteenth century, including John Ruskin and the PreRaphaelites poetry, paintings, and essays, as well as William Morris's poetry, painting and Arts and Crafts Movement. Then, as now, medievalism served multiple purposes, including aesthetic, political, and social. To put into practice what students learn and to engage their creativity, one assignment involves hand crafting an art project to be accompanied by an artist statement. In the last part of the course, the focus shifts to contemporary medievalist arts and theory. In keeping with the contemporary direction, another assignment asks students to remediate their handcrafted medievalist work, or to create a new one, using digital resources to engage both their creativity and understanding of key medievalist concepts."
ENGL 200: Introduction to Critical Reading,Responses to a variety of literary texts written in English that evoke different approaches.
ENGL 201H: What is Literature,"will familiarize students with theories and practices that are foundational for thinking about literature and for studying narrative fiction, poetry, and drama. The course will pose such questions as ""what is narrative fiction?"" ""what is poetry?"" and ""what is drama?"" It will introduce students to how conventions of literary genres operate, how they generate meaning, and how they require and manipulate readers responses. English 201H will also encourage students to explore whether or not literary discourse, as instanced in the genres that have been named, can be distinguished from other written or spoken discourses. While asking such questions, the course will acquaint students with technical vocabularies used by literary scholars and literary historians, and will provide students with sample scholarly rationales for hypothesizing the singularity of literary discourse, for constructing literary history, and for understanding literature's relation to life. It will teach students close analytic practices of reading, both those that have shaped the discipline of English studies and those emerging currently. As an honors course,  will introduce students to how conventions of literary genres operate, how they generate meaning, and how they require and manipulate readers' responses. English 201H will also encourage students to explore whether or not literary discourse, as instanced in particular genres, can be distinguished from other written or spoken discourses. While asking such questions, the course will acquaint students with technical vocabularies used by literary scholars and literary historians, and will provide students with sample scholarly rationales for hypothesizing the singularity of literary discourse, for constructing literary history, and for understanding literature's relation to life. It will teach students close analytic practices of reading, both those that have shaped the discipline of English studies and those emerging currently. Students can expect to take a highly engaged role in seminar-style discussion, including prepared presentations intended to provide a basis for that session's discussion, and which may both draw on, and emerge from, written work for the course."
ENGL 202C: Effective Writing: Technical Writing,"Writing for students in scientific and technical disciplines. (A student may take only one course for credit from , , , and .)  is an advanced writing course designed to help students in science and engineering develop the writing strategies that they will need to communicate successfully on the job and to help them understand why those strategies are appropriate and effective. A key emphasis will be on the rhetorical principles of effective communication, including context analysis and defining clear, actionable purposes. Students will gain experience with a wide range of technical writing genres, including reports, descriptions, definitions, procedures, job application documents, emails, memos, and web applications. Students will also learn about the importance of document and graphic design, including how best to design communications to maximize their potential for success."
ENGL 202H: Effective Writing: Honors,"teaches the distinctive features of professional and scholarly writing across disciplines, while inviting students to develop their professional identities. Unlike existing 202 versions 202H is designed for students in all majors, with assignments that address more area-specific expectations while highlighting commonalities and the need to communicate with non-specialist audiences. 202H is intended as rigorous preparation for third-year students preparing for an honors thesis or project, by examining how to identify and develop a topic, how to contextualize it within wider scholarship, and how to convey its significance within and beyond the field."
ENGL 205: Children's Literature,"As a child, what you read, or what is read to you, forms your first and foundational experience with literature. Moreover, what you read, and what is read to you, introduces you to the values that your culture holds dear. Despite its importance to individuals and their culture, we-instructors, students-only rarely approach children's literature with the same seriousness that we approach other works of literature. This course sets out to correct that. It assumes that texts like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, or Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! reward the kind of close and careful study that scholars and students usually reserve for more canonical works of literature. Students who take this course will leave it with a sense of the history and development of children's literature in English, the methods of studying children's literature, and, most of all, an understanding of how children's literature reproduces and occasionally challenges the values of the culture that produces and disseminates it. Its overall premise is that you can learn a lot about a culture-how it feels about childhood, race, gender, work, religion, and so on-by what that culture does and does not offer its children to read."
ENGL 213: Introduction to Poetry Writing,Written exercises in the components and techniques of poetry writing in conjunction with selected readings.
"ENGL 223N: Shakespeare: Page, Stage, and Screen","This course will explore the relation between literary analysis and both film and theatrical performance by asking students to approach a limited set of plays from multiple perspectives, using texts, film, and theatrical performance from around the world to integrate these methodologies. Students will work closely with Shakespearean texts, practice textual and poetic analysis, and will also examine critically different forms of international performance: film and live theatre. In particular, the course will explore the interrelation of these elements, revealing a deeper imaginative understanding of works that continue to influence English-speaking literature and culture."
ENGL 231: American Literature to 1865,"This course offers students a broad introduction to key moments and authors in the literary traditions that shaped US literature up to 1865. While individual authors and works discussed in class will vary, the course addresses the overall development of literatures in the United States by time periods and genres that may range from pre-Columbian oral traditions to American fiction and poetry published until the end of the Civil War. The class may feature the study of representative examples of both oral traditions and written works. In addition to highlighting enduring literary voices, the class may also highlight the development of specific genres (such as slave narratives), literary movements (such as Transcendentalism), periods of literary production (such as the American Renaissance) or other groupings of authors (such as the Fireside Poets) over the course of US literary history. Likewise, the class may include works both by authors who were popular at the time when they published their works (and thus able to impact American literature and culture during their lifetime) and those whose contributions to literary history were recognized only later. While it should be expected that no version of this course will be able to cover all authors whose works emerged before 1865, selected authors and works might include the following: examples of Native American, African American, and other oral traditions; excerpts from works by authors such as Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Phillis Wheatley, Samson Occom, Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendel Holmes, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, or Emily Dickinson."
"ENGL 234: Sports, Ethics, and Literature","A passing glance at a newspaper sports page is enough to confirm how ethically fraught the sports world is. This course explores the ethical issues that arise in a culture of competition, and it uses a variety of literary texts to ground that exploration. It seeks to provide students with a nuanced understanding of how dependent sports are on narratives, and how a variety of ethical issues underwrite existing narratives about sports. With a focus on ""the big three"" (baseball, basketball, and football), the course has a U.S. focus but also has opportunities for students to write about other sports and in non-U.S. contexts. The course connects issues in literature to issues that arise in real time as the semester unfolds. Through the readings, students will develop a heightened awareness of how different a sport can look from the ""inside,"" as an athlete or coach. The literature, that is, develops ethical imaginations and helps students think in a more complicated way about one of the most talked-about phenomena in American culture: athletics, at all levels. Units on baseball, basketball, and football focus on issues specific to those sports (e.g., the basketball unit features texts and discussions about Title IX and gender equity in sport; football on violence, injury, and athlete expendability. The course seeks to equip students to have more sophisticated conversations about sports issues, and to be more discerning as spectators and consumers of sports."
ENGL 237N: Reading and Writing Documentary Poetry,"You've probably heard of documentary photographs and documentary films, but you may not be familiar with documentary poetry. In this course, we will discuss how poets can use letters, diaries, transcripts, and other materials to create poems that capture historical events and everyday life in order to bear witness to particular moments in time. An important element of the course will be the role of documenting our world in terms of social justice and ethical responsibility. Whether focusing on public education, poverty, race, class, disability, gender, environmentalism, or other subjects, documentary poets personalize issues that are typically represented with broader brushstrokes. As Paul Metres observes, documentary poets invite ""the real life outside the poem"" into the poem itself, thereby ""testing"" the boundaries of what Wallace Stevens called ""the pressure of reality."" We will begin by viewing and discussing documentary poetry within the context of photography and filmmaking. Next, we will read and discuss documentary poems, including persona, collage, and erasure poems. These readings will also include interviews with select documentary poets about their processes. An overview of poetry terminology, research methods, and the ethics of documentary art will provide you with the basis for composing your own documentary poems. The last third of the course will be spent writing and workshopping your original documentary poems."
ENGL 262: Reading Fiction,"examines the critical, theoretical, and practical issues that readers face when reading fiction. Students will examine critical concepts ranging from fundamental analytical concerns such as plot structure, characterization, and themes, to broader ethical, philosophical, social, and political questions raised by fiction. As a genre course,  will pay special attention to the critical issues and problems raised by reading fiction, as opposed to reading poetry, drama, or non-fiction. Authors might include the following: Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Walpole, Burney, Sterne, Smollett, C.B. Brown, Austen, J.F. Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Child, Chopin, Shelley, the Brontes, G. Eliot, Dickens, Hardy, Thackeray, James, Joyce, Woolf, Bellamy, Faulkner, Hemingway, Morrison, Delillo, Reed, Barthe, Coover, Ellison, Nabokov, Wright, Welch, Erdrich, and others."
ENGL 294: Research Topics,Individual or small group instruction.
ENGL 30T: Honors Freshman Composition First-Year Seminar,"English 30T is an intensive, rhetorically based experience in reading and writing that will prepare you both to understand the communications that surround you and to succeed in your own communication efforts. Thus, in this course, we will focus specifically on analyzing verbal and visual texts (our reading) as well as on producing such texts (our writing)-always in terms of rhetorical principles. Even if the term rhetoric isn't familiar to you, you bring a good deal of rhetorical skill to this class: you already know how to gauge the way you perceive and produce language according to the speaker, the intended audience, and the purpose. You may not always gauge perfectly, your perception may not always be accurate, and your production may not always be successful-but you still often try to interpret and choose language that is appropriate to the rhetorical situation. When you do not succeed, you often try again. The goal of English 30T, then, is to help you build on what you already know how to do as you become a more confident reader and writer. You will become more attuned to your goals as a writer, more aware of the ongoing conversation surrounding the topic, and more resourceful in terms of the appropriate delivery of your information, the rhetorical appeals at your disposal, and the needs and expectations of your audience. You will also learn to research and synthesize multiple outside sources in order to support your arguments effectively and ethically. In other words, we hope you'll come to write with skill, conviction, sophistication, and grace-if not immediately, then soon. In the process, you'll learn how to read more critically as well. As an honors section,  is enriched by more rigorous requirements (longer papers, additional research component where the student is required to cite and engage critical sources and conversations). Participation requirements are also enhanced, making for a richer honors experience."
ENGL 312H: Globality and Literature,"This course examines contemporary fiction that reflects on globality and globalization, most often from contexts where planetary crisis registers as linguistic or narrative disturbance: war, empire, economic underdevelopment, state repression, diaspora, immigration, or major historical shifts. Anglophone writings will be read alongside works in translation to track the common-or uncommon-conditions of humanity that results from economic and political globalization. The course pays special attention to questions of violence and justice, the principal preoccupations of human rights discourse. This Honors section is enriched by more rigorous requirements (longer papers, and a research component to each paper where the student is required to cite and engage critical sources and conversations). Participation requirements are also enhanced, making for a richer honors experience."

In addition to primary aesthetic texts, students will read historical, political, and theoretical essays designed to situate the Chicano/a cultural texts in historical and political context.The aim of the course is to give students a better understanding of Chicano/a cultural production by situating these works of art against other U. S. artistic traditions and within wider historical and political movements. Authors and artists under consideration in this class will vary, but will likely include Luis Valdez, Tomas Rivera, Estella Portillo Trambley, Oscar Zeta Acosta, Corky Gonzales, Gloria Anzaldua, Norma Alarcon, Cherrie Moraga, Richard Rodriguez, Dagoberto Gilb, Rolando Hinojosa, Alfredo Vea, Charlie Trujillo, Diego Vasquez Jr., Joe Rodriguez, Tomas Almaguer, Jose Esteban Munoz, Manuel Ramos, Lucha Corpi, Rudolfo Anaya, Michael Nave. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in Latin/a literatures as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex texts.

ENGL 437: The Poet in America,"American poets such as Bradstreet, Taylor, Poe, Emerson, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Eliot, Stevens, Hughes, Brooks, Moore, Williams, Plath, Rich, Lowell."
ENGL 441: Chaucer,"This course surveys the literary career of Geoffrey Chaucer, perhaps the most celebrated English-language poet of the medieval ear. The course primarily examines Chaucer's own writings, with consideration of the several international authors and traditions that informed his own literary productions. Selections may vary, but students will read texts from across Chaucer's career, including from major works like Troilus and Criseyde and The Canterbury Tales. Readings from Chaucer's sources and models may include translated selections from Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy or from Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun's Romance of the Rose, and/or examples from relevant literary genres such as romance, fabliaux, beast fable, sermon, tragedy, and exemplum. Accordingly, students will develop a knowledge and appreciation of how Chaucer shaped (and was shaped by) his continental influences and the ways in which he developed a poetic tradition in English that proved deeply influential for many centuries."
ENGL 446: Milton,Analysis of principal poems and their background.
ENGL 484: James Joyce,Analysis of principal works and their background.
ENGL 488: Modern Continental Drama,Study of major traditions and writers in European drama of the early to mid twentieth century.
ENGL 489: British Women Writers,"A study of selected British women writers.  ENGL (WMNST) 489 British Women Writers (3) This course provides the opportunity to study writing by British Women from a historical perspective and to explore the views these women have of themselves as artists. The course will concentrate on a careful reading of works by a variety of authors. It will address the question of the role gender plays in the selection of literary forms and the development of character, theme, symbols, and rhetorical strategies. It will also explore what particular dimensions British women writers have brought to the British literary tradition.Students will be active learners through keeping reading journals, presenting background reports on the history of women in England, participating in small-group discussions about the texts, and writing 2 shorter essays and one longer research essay for the class. This course focuses on an area of British literature, which more traditionally structured courses tend to obscure. The course will be attractive to students from a variety of programs, including English majors, Women's Studies minors, and Interdisciplinary Humanities students. The course will be offered once every two years. Estimated class size 20."
ENGL 490: Women Writers and Their Worlds,"American and British literature written from the perspective of women.  ENGL (WMNST) 490 Women Writers and Their Worlds (3) (US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. ENGL/ covers particular aspects of American and British literature written from the perspective of women. The courses stress the diversity of women's authorial worlds, both through time and/or space. The readings and specific focus vary from semester to semester. ENGL/ seeks to make students aware of the extensive body of literature written by women, but, unlike , which is a survey course of women's literature, ENGL/ can be a more intensive course, focusing on selected themes and topics of particular concern to women as reflected in the poetry and fiction of twentieth-century American and British women writers. The class can also be taught in relationship to earlier periods, dealing, for instance, with English women novelists from 1775-1865. In such a class, readings would include fiction by Fanny Burney, Mary Wolistonecraft, Ann Radcliffe, Jane Austen, Mary Shelly, Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot. The course would then place each novel in its historical, social, intellectual, and literary context, and explore the various ways in which some of England's best writers transformed their female experience of the world into fiction that extended the range and influenced the development of the novel. Regardless of the particular focus, all sections of the course pose the following questions throughout: Do women use the same myths, archetypes, and literary conventions as male writers? Or do they sometimes have to modify the myths, archetypes, and literary conventions originated by their male precursors in order to adapt them to female experience? Is there such a thing as a distinctively female imagination, with a symbolic language of its own? Is there such a thing as a chain of literary influence linking women writers to each other? What are the strategies for coping with the anxieties of authorship? What is the interaction between gender and genre? In what ways are creativity and procreativity modes of defying prevailing ideologies? Does a woman's psychological development have an effect on the plots a woman novelist conceives? How does women's literature reflect the realities of women's lives? As a course in women's literature, ENGL/ concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course, two course papers, and an essay final exam in class. The papers each will ask students to choose a text to analyze in relationship to one of the thematic modules the course has chosen, for instance, to discuss how Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway analyzes the position of upper-middle class women in a particular moment in history when women had achieved the vote, but were still largely constrained by patriarchal social norms. In addition to written assignments, students will be evaluated on class discussion and general participation. The course not only prepares students for taking up literary and cultural analysis in English classes, but also in any other class that engages in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and in other classes in Women's Studies or in other Penn State departments that address the social, cultural, or ethical issues of gender. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor; it may also be used in the Women's Studies major and minor. It will be offered once a year with 40 seats per offering."

This statement, originally articulated by the ancient Roman poet Horace, has been quoted and debated ever since. Links between art and literature have exerted a formative influence on the development of modern fiction and poetry as authors and artists in various avant-garde groupings collaborated and competed to generate modes of artistic expression appropriate to modernity. This course examines those interactions. Course objectives are to bring together for comparative examination: -    formal or generic relationships between texts and images at particular historical moments. -     issues of creative collaboration and cross-pollination between writers and artists, which have been crucially important in the history of literature and poetry. -     conceptions of creativity as these have been expressed by writers using the figure of the artist. This course allows students to explore the ways knowledge of literature and skills in critical reading can be rewardingly brought to bear on the visual arts, and to consider how visual art can illuminate the workings of literature both for individual readers and in the classroom."

Success in this class depends upon the student's ability to set priorities, organize materials, followup on initial contacts with presses and editors, and revise all reviews to publishable standards. Students begin by reading published book reviews and two texts (one poetry, one fiction) assigned by the instructor. Analyzing the structure of the published reviews, students draft model 200- and 550-word reviews, using the published reviews as guides. As the course progresses, students contact publishing houses and presses to request review copies, while simultaneously writing to editors with project proposals. With longer reviews--700 and 1,000 words--students engage complex issues about the economics and politics of publishing. Readings from the course Sampler (provided by instructor) inspire students to position themselves as literary citizens in the national conversation about contemporary writing.

The course then moves on to non-Treasury segments of the fixed income markets: forward contracts, repurchasing agreements, floating rate notes, swaps, single stock futures, corporate bonds. For each topic, standard pricing techniques and relevant practical issues will be discussed. For example, how can a fixed income investor price a bond newly issued by a corporation based on their past equity market performance, using techniques typically employed by Moody's KMV? How does an investor gauge the potential illiquidity of a bond when transaction data are sparse? Or how one can extract a measure of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) from the single stock futures markets? Or how a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) could hedge interest rate risks using standard duration and convexity hedging techniques even in a quick moving environment when assumptions underlying these techniques are likely, to varying degrees, violated.

FIN 495A: Lead Fund Manager Practicum,"Nittany Lion Fund -- Lead Fund Manager Practicum (3 per semester/maximum of 6) A Lead Fund Manager is accountable for sector performance as well as sector output. This means that while the Lead Fund Manager has to be an effective delegator of work to his or her Associate(s), the manager must also have great attention to detail when reviewing all aspects of pitches, weekly reports, and earnings reports. A Lead Fund Manager focuses more on knowing the big trends in his or her overall sector and in each subsector. The Lead is the strategist for the sector. He or she has the responsibility of choosing what stocks to pitch in class and at PSIA meetings. This means that the Leads must constantly reevaluate not only their current portfolio, but the sector as a whole, in order to find where to best allocate their respective funds. Another major responsibility that a Lead Fund Manager has is to lead a group of anywhere from 10-50 PSIA members. While there are weekly educations for the PSIA analysts, it is one of the most important responsibilities of a Lead Fund Manager to provide support for the PSIA analysts to help them with their PSIA certification assignments. In addition to helping the analysts understand their weekly assignments, the Lead Fund Managers are also responsible for holding weekly sector meetings to give sector-specific educations to a smaller group of PSIA analysts. The goal for any Lead should be to get as many PSIA analysts as involved and interested as possible in PSIA. The interest generated should draw PSIA analysts to apply for entrance into the Nittany Lion Fund. PSIA is the feeder system for the NLF and making sure there are intelligent and motivated applicants each semester ensures that the investment group will continue to have a strong class going forward. Consequently, once the Lead Manager has developed analysts' interest in applying for the NLF, it is an unwritten responsibility of the Lead to help the applicants to become as best prepared as possible for the interviews (Associates are encouraged to help new applicants as well). In total, the role that the Lead plays is not just that of a figurehead, the Lead must be well informed of current events and trends within their sector, and they must be able to speak eloquently of their investment strategy when speaking in class, at PSIA meetings, or to investors at the yearly investment meeting."

FIN 881: Fundamentals of Financial Markets,"This course provides a broad understanding of the pricing mechanism of the bond, equity, and foreign exchange markets. The course also gives students an overview of analytical methodologies that help market participants discern asset price from asset value. How can a market participant understand when they are ""buying low and selling high""? In particular, the course investigates the following questions related to understanding financial markets and why this understanding is important to success as a strategic corporate manager: ¿  - What is the language of financial markets' how do market actors read financial statements with a critical eye to understand assets' future value? - What is the difference between price and value? - What, theoretically, is the ""intrinsic value of an asset? What analytical techniques can the financial market participant use to approximate intrinsic value? -  How are decisions made given that market results are uncertain? - How are decisions made probabilistically using the basic concepts of expected value and standard deviation? - What is the difference between an ""optimal"" decision using market data vs. an ""accurate"" decision? - How do we understand that the concept of risk is multi-layered and multi-dimensional? - Which risks are associated with which markets, i.e., bonds vs. equities etc., and how do market participants mitigate risk through hedging? - Are markets rational or are they subject to ""behavioral"" characteristics? - How do we understand and quantify our corporation's risk profile and how does that determine our decisions to employ capital in one asset market vs. another? At the end of the course students should have a sense that decisions to buy or sell an asset in any financial market are imperfect, and that new information alters the value of assets extremely quickly. As a result, students must develop a keen sense of how markets are moving, and why they are moving in one direction or the other. More importantly, students will realize that decisions must be made, assets must be bought or sold, and hopefully, valuation techniques lead to profitable outcomes."

LaBelle Epoque: Politics, Society, and Culture in France, 1880-1914 (3) (IL) The goal of this course is to present and analyze the period of extraordinary changes in all domains known as the ""Belle Epoque."" The starting point for an examination of these changes is Guy de Maupassant's novel, Bel-Ami (1885), which describes the social and professional ascension of an egotistical Parisian parvenu, Georges Duroy.  The reading of this novel will allow us at the same time to study in detail one of the novel's protagonists: Paris.  Through our discussions and through consideration of a wide range of primary and secondary texts, we will examine the complex rapport between literature (as well as art) and society at the end of the nineteenth century, and we will attempt to answer questions such as: how did the changing Parisian landscape inspire the authors, artists et musicians of this era? How did the new Parisian space encourage the development of new ""places of pleasure"" cafes, cabarets, cafes-concerts, theaters, racetracks, restaurants, etc.? How did innovations in architecture and the decorative arts, which flourished under the name of Art Nouveau, reflect both social developments and the transforming profile of Paris?

FRNSC 100: Introduction to Forensic Science,"This course is designed for students to step into the role of a criminalist ¿ one who performs the scientific examination of evidence - as they process a case from start to finish over the semester. Students begin by learning a scientific approach to crime scene investigation, evidence collection, and transport. They then follow the collected evidence as it is disseminated throughout the crime lab for examination and analysis. Disciplines such as forensic serology, trace evidence, impression evidence, drug chemistry, toxicology, and DNA will be discussed. Students will learn about the examinations performed by crime lab professionals; the application of scientific principles from disciplines such biology, chemistry, physics, and math to those exams; and the instrumentation commonly used in the lab to complete those examinations and analyses. Once the evidence has been processed, students will use critical thinking skills to interpret the evidence within the context of the case. They will reconstruct the crime as it could have occurred guided by the results and conclusions generated from their analyses. Students will also explore the role of various scientific disciplines outside of criminalistics (anthropology, entomology, pathology, etc.) as they are used in modern forensics, as well as the role of forensic science in society and the criminal justice system."

This is done with the intent of training students in the habits of successful game designers- namely, playing games thoughtfully, and then documenting those thoughts. The successful student will have a clear and thoughtful record of at least 15 games he or she has played and analyzed with a critical eye by the end of the semester. These should be peppered with thoughtful critique on the games industry, and musings on trends in game design. This will of course become clear as the course progresses. The culmination of this course will result in the creation of a professional, competent game designer portfolio and blog that can be used in search for a job, to represent oneself as an independent game developer, and to showcase the talents and skills developed over this course and its prerequisite."
GAME 450: Advanced Game Programming,"Autonomously generating object behavior and content in games.   Advanced Game Programming (3) The course is developed in two parts, creating programs to automatically generate object behavior and world content. Students are first introduced to the mathematical basis of vectors and transforms. This is necessary to create engaging characters that properly display behaviors and interact with the player and the world. These behaviors can range from orientating towards the player or pursuing/fleeing from some object in the game. In the presence of obstacles these behaviors require path finding algorithms like A* in order to navigate through the world. Students then learn how to create challenges that adapt their difficulty level based on the user's proficiency and skill in the game. In order to reduce costs and meet the demand to get a product to market, the gaming industry is looking for ways to automate the content generation. Instead of hiring a room-full of artists to generate the layout of a city, a computer can be programmed to dynamically generate this content at run-time, saving not only the work-load of the artists, but also the storage space necessary for the representation of the city. An optimization method like genetic algorithms is presented so that dynamically generated content like the layout of building and streets in a city can be produced at run-time. From the beginning of video games mazes and labyrinths have been a common theme and one of the first examples of run-time generated content. Students are introduced to a variety of maze generation methods using a variety of methods. Fractal geometry is introduced to provide a powerful tool to recursively generate natural looking content like plants and terrain. The mathematical basis of chaotic systems provides the theoretical background necessary to understand the limits of these methods as well as how to apply them to create new content. In addition to the technical content, students are required to demonstrate effective communication skills in these disciplines. Students are required to read and report out on a research paper of historical note or in an emerging field in content generation. Finally, a final project in the course will demonstrate the application of two or more of the concepts covered in the class."

GEOG 10: Physical Geography:  An Introduction,"Survey and synthesis of processes creating geographical patterns of natural resources, with application of basic environmental processes in resource management.  GEOG 010GEOG 010 Introduction to Physical Geography (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.Introduction to Physical Geographysystematically examines the spatial patterns and interrelationships among physical elements at the earth's surface. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how atmospheric, hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes control the patterns of climate, water, landforms, soils, and biota across a local-to-global continuum. Those physical elements that influence and/or are influenced by people are the primary focus of study.Physical geography does not simply discuss the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding theintegrationof these realms of the natural world. For example, the study of weathering processes demonstrates how the physical and chemical breakdown of Earth's surface material depends on the interaction of air, water, and biota with rock.The focus of physical geography is unlike the component disciplines from which it draws. On the one, hand, meteorology focuses on the atmosphere above our heads. Hydrology focuses on water in isolation from people. Geology and soil science focus on the Earth beneath our feet. Biology and ecology focus on the plants, animals, and ecosystems in isolation from people. One the other hand, physical geography concentrates on the surface of the Earth where the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere intersect.Introduction to Physical Geographyis concerned with the human habitat-the life layer in which humans interact with their natural world.Like all geography, five recurring themes permeateIntroduction to Physical Geography : location, place, regions, movement, and human-environment relationships. Physical geographers not only are interested in where natural phenomena are located on Earth's surface, but also they want to know the answers to such questions as:1. What is special about the physical processes that take place in a location? 2. How does the physical geography of a place relate to other places in the region? 3. How does energy and mass flow into and out of a region? 4. How do biophysical processes change as we move up and down spatial scales? 5. How do people influence natural processes? How do these processes influence people?Other disciplines typically do not cover these spatial and nature-society themes systematically.Physical geographers have developed and adopted many tools to address these themes. Maps are obvious choices, but geographers also use a wide array of photographic and imaging technologies to study the distribution of Earth processes and the processes themselves. They use geographic information systems and computer models to manipulate, display, and analyze spatial data.Introduction to Physical Geographyacquaints students with many of these tools.When the above points are taken together, physical geography emerges as a unique field of science.Introduction to Physical Geographyprovides a learning experience that students can get in no other discipline-one that takes an integrated view that makes the nature environment relevant."
GEOG 128: Geography of International Affairs,"Contemporary international affairs in their geographical setting; geographic elements in the development of national power, political groupings, and international disputes.  Geography of International Affairs (3) (GS;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Geography of International Affairs uses the organizing principle of geographic scale to examine the spatial patterns of and interrelationships among political processes and institutions. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how global, national, local and individual scale processes interact to produce patterns of peace and conflict. The course analyzes how the actions of individuals, states and other political actors are influenced by their dynamic geographical contexts. The political geography approach does not simply discuss the war, peace, nationalism, terrorism, and religious organizations in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding the integration of these processes, and how their integration mediates political decisions and outcomes. Geography of International Affairs is concerned with the geopolitical context, broadly defined - the manner in which spaces and places are combinations of the political and the social, the domestic and the international, the global and the local - and how it partially determines the form and outcomes of politics. As a course in geography, Geography of International Affairs encourages students to interpret political problems, actions, and disputes through the lens of the Six Essential Elements of Geography (National Geographic): Places and Regions; Physical Systems; Human Systems: Environment and Society; the World in Spatial Terms; and Uses of Geography. Further, this course also encourages students to examine and interpret international affairs through the lens of different geopolitical theories, developed by the likes of Ratzel, Mahan, Mackinder, Spykman, Kissinger, Wallerstein, and others. In this sense, students are encouraged to adopt the role of political geographers. Political geographers have developed and adopted many tools to address these themes. Maps are obvious choices, but geographers also use a wide array of statistical and qualitative techniques to study the distribution of political processes and the processes themselves. They use geographic information systems and computer models to manipulate, display, and analyze spatial data. Geography of International Affairs acquaints students with many of these tools. When the above points are taken together, political geography emerges as a unique field of social science. Geography of International Affairs provides a learning experience that students can get in no other discipline - one that takes an integrated view that makes contemporary international affairs relevant and understandable."
GEOG 220: Perspectives on Human Geography,"Why are some countries richer than others? How do consumption patterns in one part of the world affect `far flung' peoples and environments? How does global warming shape land use patterns and rates of hunger across different regions, and what are the political implications of these patterns? Why do rich economies around the world increasingly depend on the recruitment of low-wage immigrant workers, both ""legal"" and ""illegal""? How do race and gender shape access to services, housing and employment in many large cities? In what ways does drone warfare change the nature of state power in the 21st century? These kinds of questions are ones that animate the work of human geographers. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the breadth of contemporary human geography. We will explore both the range of topics that geographers study, and some of the key concepts and methods used to study geographic topics. Major themes will investigate how cultural, economic, political, and environmental interactions relate to geographic processes. These general topics will be explored through a detailed examination of case studies in the United States and across the globe"
GEOG 260: Geographic Information in a Changing World: Introduction to GIScience,"In a rapidly changing world, detailed, up-to-date geographic data are indispensable ingovernance, commerce, security, public health, and many other domains. These data are also needed to support research intended to improve our understanding of social and environmental systems. Making data useful in these domains requires methods and tools that transform data to information and that make that information accessible where and when it is needed. Geographic data specify the locations and characteristics of people, and objects both natural and anthropogenic in nature. Geographic data are produced by several formal methods, including land surveying, aerial photography and photogrammetry, satellite remote sensing and positioning systems, and social surveys such as those conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. They also are derived through informal methods that rely on the vast and growing array of location-enabled devices including cell phones, smart watches, credit card transaction records, and RFID tags on packages, along with volunteers compiling input to projects such as the Open Street Map. Geographic informationsystems (GIS) and related technologies are used to turn those data into the information people need to make informed decisions. Maps and related graphics generated on a wide array of devices from cell phones to large touch-screen displays then make the information more accessible and by doing so enable those decisions.Geographic Information Science (GIScience) is concerned with the design, development, and use of geographic information and technologies (also called geospatial technologies) to help institutions and individuals respond to, and ideally to predict, environmental and social change. This course provides a broad, practical foundation of Geographic Information Science methods and technologies for aspiring Geography majors and students pursuing the Geographic Information Science minor or undergraduate certificate, as well as students whose academic programs utilize geospatial information and analysis. Course Objectives The overall objectives of  are that students will: 1. gain a broad perspective on geographic information science and related technologies and how those technologies are used to collect, process, and provide access to geographic data; 2. be prepared for more advanced study of GIS, remote sensing, cartography, and spatial analysis. After the course, students will be prepared to demonstrate: 1. Familiarity with the professional, academic, and industry-specific competencies (Positioning & Data Acquisition; Analysis & Modeling; Software & Application Development) specified in the U.S. Department of Labor's Geospatial Technology Competency Model (GTCM). 2. How to appropriately acquire, apply, and communicate geographic data and information 3. Lifelong learning skills, including the ability to investigate topics independently, the ability to work in teams, and the ability to communicate effectively. 4. The ability to use maps and geospatial technology as a story-telling medium. 5. How and why Geographic Information Science matters in a changing world."

You will have an opportunity in this course to: learn how tousestatistics in your own work; learn how toconsumestatistics in everyday life The statistical methods you will learn to use are simple descriptive statistics that we use to summarize complex data, as well as the associated charts, diagrams and maps. From there, we will move on to look at chance and probability theory, and simple inferential statistics.Throughout the course, we will be concerned with &ldquo;everyday statistics&rdquo;, primarily as it relates to geography. Contemporary media are saturated with statistics, from reports of climatic change, through latest presidential election polls, to batting averages and yards-gained statistics in sports. A lot of the presentation of these statistics is lazy or inaccurate, and often misleading (whether, deliberately or not), and a major theme of this course will be to look at the issues involved.During most lectures we will spend some time working with sample problems, and to discuss practical applications. These activities are meant to build a deeper understanding of the subject matter but it also relies heavily on your active participation. You will often have work to prepare before lectures or other types of lecture homework.Labs will give you experience with statistics functions in Excel before moving onto SPSS as well as other statistical software, and also with mapping statistical data using GIS software."

GEOG 423Y: Historical Geography of North America,"Exploration, settlement, and changing patterns of human occupance from the seventeenth century to the 1930s.  GEOG 432Y Historical Geography of North America (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This is an upper-division, writing-intensive course that presents an overview of current scholarship on the evolving historical geography of the continent. It does this through a set of lectures given by the instructor, through directed readings that will be the basis of class discussion, and centrally through research essays that offer students the opportunity to research, write and argue historical geographies. Research in historical geography is a process of engagement with partial evidence and with secondary material to open windows on aspects of past lives, past economies, and past places. Since an introductory level overview of the historical geographies of the continent is presented in : The American Scene, this class does not offer a comprehensive survey of regions and periods. Rather, it focuses on three themes -staples and the colonial era, local transformations in agricultural and industrial communities in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, and the packaging of memory as a way to expose students to primary evidence and current debates.In the unit on the colonial era, the focus is on a variety of records that illuminate the development of economies based on staples such as fish, fur, tobacco, rice and iron, drawing on evidence from the Lords of Trade and Plantations in London, and from correspondence between merchants and planters, as well as scholarship on the material culture of houses, farms and settlements. For the unit on local change, workshops illustrate how to tease out information from the manuscript census, county atlases and corporate histories; students then pursue similar material for a locale of their own choice and submit drafts of an evolving research essay. A short presentation to the class encourages the effective distillation of visual and data evidence to communicate research findings. On the packaging of memory, the class critically examines how historic sites are presented, and how interpretations have changed in response to shifting academic and popular concerns. Lectures are interspersed with discussions of readings, workshop demonstrations, and by student presentations. Eleven distinct writing exercises are used as the basis of allocating the overall grade."
GEOG 426W: Gendered Worlds,"Gendered Worlds examines how systems of dominance manifest in everyday life. Through an intersectional approach to social differences, such as gender, race, class, ethnicity, age, ability, and sexuality, the course highlights the significance of difference in shaping experiences of space and place in a global context. The course incorporates approaches from cultural, postcolonial, subaltern, queer, gender, and critical race studies, all of which have influenced current debates across the field of geography. Feminist scholars have long been concerned with the spatial politics of cultural difference. As a point of entry to discussions of gender and geography, this course will explore the diverse ways in which geographers have conceived of, analyzed, and redefined gender as a contested spatial practice that intersects with other facets of identity such as race, class, and sexuality. Using contemporary geographic texts, we will explore the gendered dynamics of geographic research, citizenship, violence, security, nationalism, nature,and globalization. The purpose of this course is to examine how gender is understood and utilized in the field of geography. This course also aims to enhance students' ability to engage in first-hand critical research, as well as collaborative learning, through a reflective and on-going process of research and writing over the course of the semester. At the end of the course, the successful student will be able to: 1. Deploy contemporary debates around gender theory, gendered spatial practices, and cultural difference. 2. Critique the cultural and social construction of gender across time and cultures. 3. Analyze representations of gender in social institutions such as the media. 4.

The majority of the Earth's surface is covered by water and thus it seems likely that the human race will become increasingly dependent on oceanic resources in the future. This course seeks to illuminate how the ocean will respond to increased anthropogenic pressure. Students are shown how such issues can be addressed through detailed understanding of the complex interplay between the physical, chemical and biological properties of the ocean. Lectures focus on fundamental principles of natural sciences as related to the ocean using extensive graphics, video clips and demonstrations."

Introduction to German Film History and Theory in Context (3) This course focuses on German cinema's development since the 1960s. The course situates the 'Young' and then 'New German Cinema' within contemporaneous European and U.S. film cultures. Thus the course will address the difference between the European cinematic culture of 'auteurs' versus the school of 'genres' in the U.S.The preceding traditions of Italian Neo-realism and of the Frenchnouvelle vagueare also engaged alongside a few Hungarian, Czech and/or Polish films. The students will have the opportunity to consider how these other national cinematic productions impacted the German filmmakers who were involved in the creation of a national German cinema that would critically engage Hollywood on the one hand, and distance itself from the Nazi past on the other.The course will be structured around questions about the grounds for a national cinema and its cultural and critical relevance both at the time these films were produced and today. Yet, the national question will not be the only focus of this class, in the course of which students will be able to discuss the historical, political and ethical questions raised by the directors selected. In addition, students in this course will learn about the specificity of cinematic language and will be exposed to some film theory. In conclusion, the course provides upper level undergraduate students with a basic knowledge of the most important New German films, with a confrontation with issues specifically relevant to a study of German culture, and with some familiarity with film theory.The evaluation methods for this course will be based on 1) participation [attendance; reports/worksheets, after each film and in class discussion]: 30%; 2) presentation 20%; 3) take-home mid term essay 20%; and 4) final paper 30%.

GER 534: History of German Film and Photography,"This course will examine the history, theory, and practice of German photographic and moving picture technology from its origins to the digital age. The course will be structured around important innovations in visual technology, including: 1) the pre-history and invention of photography, 2) pre-cinematic moving pictures (Anschütz), 3) the invention of cinema (Skladanowsky Bros.), 4) sound and color innovations, 5) video, digital, and installation work. The aim of the course is to provide an historical overview of visual culture in which the radical shifts inaugurated by new technologies are examined in terms of their aesthetic, philosophical, and political impact. In the German context these shifts have been examined by important theoreticians of visual culture (most notably Arnheim, Balácz, Benjamin, Kracauer, and Flusser) whose work has changed the way we think about our relation to images. Practitioners in the German sphere have been no less influential: from Ottomar Anschütz's pre-cinematic experiments with moving pictures to the very first public demonstration of cinematic technology (the Skladanowskys' bioscope, one month before the Lumières' first show) to the avant-garde animation of the Weimar period; from the narrative and design innovations of the Expressionist filmmakers to the rich and varied independent films of the New German Cinema to the radical documentarians of the past decade. By providing students with an understanding of German innovations in and responses to new technologies this course will ground readings of particular works historically. In broad terms, class discussion will consider questions such as: What is the aesthetic status of the photographic image in relation to painting? What is the ontological status of the photograph as a chemical imprint of light? How do these new technologies lend themselves to political action? How is the spectator differently constructed by these technologies? In what way is the still image integral to the moving image-and what implications do these have for our perception of time? What is the new role of the image in mass, consumer culture (subversive or complicit)? How do the formal and technical affordances of the film-based image contribute to the construction of national, race, and gender identities, to spectator desires, and to new aesthetic categories? Readings will be available in German and in English. Class discussion will be in English."

"GLIS 310: Language Rights, Policy, and Planning","This is a course on language rights, policy, and planning from individual, group, inter-ethnic, and national perspectives. Linguistic minorities are a consequence of colonization by European powers in different regions of the globe. Other effects of colonization and political conflicts include mass movement, migration, and the emergence of nationalism. In such contexts, minorities have made demands for language rights and used language policy and planning as strategies to realize demands for social justice. This course will examine how linguistic minorities secure opportunities to use their own languages and have them accommodated in official legislation as mother tongue, second, or foreign languages. The course will adopt a global perspective and analyze language rights as well as language policy and planning in diverse regions of the globe, including but not restricted to, Africa, Asia, and South America. Analysis will primarily focus on how language policies can be carried out from different perspectives (e.g., literary, linguistic, and political) in different geographical regions. After examining how language policies operate in and influence society, the course will use sociopolitical ideologies to explore the nature of the relationship between language policies and language rights and the ways this relationship enables one to achieve an expanded understanding of the impact of language policies and language rights on local language practices."

HDFS 440: Family Policy,"An in-depth examination of family policy.  HD FS (SOC) 440 Family Policy (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course is designed to provide an in-depth examination of family policy. Students will identify and critically analyze major issues, controversies, and policies that affect families. Attention will be devoted to recognizing both intended and unintended consequences of family policies and understanding policy challenges and trade-offs. Students will gain an understanding of how policies are shaped by both facts and myths, as well as our values. Students will examine historical and current trends in family patterns (e.g., divorce, women's labor force participation, nonmarital births) to understand the implications they hold for individuals, families and society. Students will gain an awareness of the social, economic, historical, legal, and political contexts within which family policies exist and are proposed. Although the main focus is on U.S. family policy, some time will be devoted to learning about family policies in other countries. We will learn about several specific family policies in-depth (e.g., welfare), but a final goal is to help students develop a general way of looking at family policy that they can then use to understand any issue of family policy that unfolds throughout their lifetime. This course will foster thoughtful reflection and critical thinking, writing skills, research skills, and skills of synthesis, logic, and argument. Course goals will be accomplished through course readings, writing assignments, lectures, class discussions, debates and group projects. Mastery of course material and student evaluation are assessed in several ways. Students will take a midterm and final exam that cover lectures, class discussions, and assigned readings. Two papers are also required. The first paper is based on an analysis of newspaper articles dealing with family policy issues that students will collect and relate to course materials. The second paper is a literature-based analysis of a family policy in a society outside the United States.

HD FS 469U Family Change in the Global Economy (3) (IL) We know that family life, structure, and practices undergo dramatic change when there are economic and political changes in the society. Economic globalization is unprecedented as a force for social and political change. How is it affecting family life and structures around the world? While we have considerable research on globalization and on family change, there has been little work that connects the two.This is an exploratory seminar that involves locating those linkages and discovering families in each world region are changing as they meet up with global economic forces. As we explore each world region, we will learn about diverse cultures and how they are affected by global forces. In the Americas, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Europe this course uncovers new forms of inequality that are emerging from the global economy and having direct effects on women and families. Through it all, we explore how human action, in the family, the community and the society, struggles for quality of life in a global economic context."

HD FS 530 Longitudinal Structural Equation Modeling (3) This course provides a broad overview of structural equations modeling as a method for studying developmental processes in Human Development and Family Studies. In this course, students gain a thorough hands-on understanding of a wide variety of statistical model types as special cases of the General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with latent variables. Specific statistical model types covered include: exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis; linear, nonlinear and multivariate latent growth curve modeling; quasi-simplex modeling; longitudinal factor modeling; multi-group factor analysis, including a concise introduction to behavior genetic modeling; mediation analysis; testing for measurement equivalence; MANCOVA with nonstandard within-subject covariance structures; outlines of statistical selection theory and principal component analysis. The presentation of these diverse model types as special instances of the same GLMM is helpful to understanding their relationships and differences and considerably streamlines applied statistical modeling. Each of these statistical model types are commonly used to analyze data from studies in the field of Human Development and Family Studies and illustrative examples are provided. Each model type is explained at 4 levels: 1) in terms of a set of simultaneous model equations; 2) as a set of matrix equations; 3) as a graphical model; and 4) as a Lisrel input code. All model assumptions are made explicit and the interrelationships between the 4 levels of model representation are emphasized. Then the model is applied to simulated and real data. The obtained model fits are assessed in terms of various statistical criteria and conclusions are explicitly drawn based on standard statistical decision theory. Selected models from studies of Human Development and other social sciences are interpreted in terms of content and possible pitfalls in their interpretation are discussed. For each modeling technique appropriate background publications, lecture notes and advanced reading material on nonstandard topics are provided."

HDFS 535: Integrating Qualitative Methods into Quantitative Research,"Focuses on effective ways to integrate qualitative methods into quantitative approaches to research in human development and family studies. The purpose of this course is to cover how best to combine quantitative and qualitative methods in human development and family studies research. This course begins with the assumption that students have an existing research question to test through quantitative approaches that involve the formulation of research hypotheses before data collection. The course then explores how qualitative data approaches can further enhance their study. This course emphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches through 1) designing qualitative projects to test hypotheses, 2) the importance of sampling, and 3) coverage of R for analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data. The course begins with an overview of mixed methods research. The course then addresses qualitative research and the development of qualitative research projects, before describing how to combine quantitative and qualitative data. The course will address best practices for sampling in mixed methods research. The course then will cover specific issues in qualitative research such as ethnographic data, intensive interviewing, and focus groups. The remainder of the course will cover specific issues in mixed methods designs, such as research designs, divergent findings, life history calendars, and statistical programs for mixed methods data."

The majority of each entry should be a clear statement of what knowledge gains would be realized by conducting the study and why they are important. The remainder of the statement should include consideration of the data you would use, measures of major variables, and analytic strategies. Think of it as a brief portfolio of thesis, dissertation, or research publication ideas.Entries on research projects in which you are already involved are not eligible for inclusion in the journal. On the last page of the journal, indicate which problem you would like to develop into a more detailed proposal during the remainder of the semester and why. Turn in the journal during week 5. I will evaluate your entries and comment on your selection idea. The rest of the semester will be spent on developing one of the ideas to a full-blown proposal (about 20 pages). You should turn in as many drafts as needed to receive a good grade for this segment of the course. I expect you to turn in three or more before the end of the semester. We will meet about each draft and go over my comments. Proposal drafts should be spaced out over the semester.The last week of the semester will be devoted to presentations of research proposals after which class members will offer comments and suggestions. Your grade will be based on the proposal draft you turn in the last week of the class. Twenty-one percent of the course grade is based on the research proposal."

HHD 200N: Addiction Science to Society,"Addiction is commonly defined as set of compulsive behaviors that cannot be stopped despite negative consequences. The term itself is controversial and defined differently by various disciplines. This has resulted in skewed perceptions of addiction by society as a whole. This course aims to inform students on the biological, psychological, and sociological viewpoints of addiction and how they interact to form an integrated perspective (the biopsychosocial model). By understanding the current knowledge on the biological and psychological bases of addiction, students will be better prepared to make knowledgeable decisions on their own behaviors, understand the behavior of others, and generate informed opinions on the social aspects of addiction. We will begin by comparing and contrasting the different ways addiction has been defined in various fields and exploring the debate on which substances/behaviors are actually considered addictive. Throughout the course, students will broadly explore basic concepts in biology (cells, neural communication, brain anatomy, use of animal models, pharmacology, genetics, epigenetics, and comorbidity), psychology (memory, conditioning, reward, expectancy, bias, and mental health) and sociology (family systems theory, stress theory, developmental theory, feminist theory). These concepts will be practically applied to various questions concerning 1. The status of addiction as a disease. 2. How addiction is or should be treated. 3. The effects of addiction on family and society. 4. Policies concerning the criminalization of drugs and compulsive behaviors. In addition, methods and data from primary research in all three domains of the biopsychosocial model will be analyzed. Several assignments using various forms of communication will serve to illustrate the connections and asses integrated learning."

HIED 840: Assessing Student Outcomes & Evaluating Academic Programs,"Academic program assessment/student outcomes in accountability and accreditation processes.  HI ED 840 Assessing Student Outcomes & Evaluating Academic Programs (3) This course pulls together the many threads that add up to educational effectiveness: evaluating academic programs and curricula, assessing student learning outcomes, coping with accountability and performance reporting requirements, responding to the demands of both regional and disciplinary/vocational accreditation bodies. The course acquaints students with strategies and instruments for conducting outcomes studies of programs, students, and alumni alike. Assessment topics include studies of students' basic skills, general education, knowledge in the major, personal growth, and alumni outcomes. Thus, the course is designed for higher education professionals who seek to a fuller understanding of Student Outcomes Assessment, Program Evaluation, and Institutional Effectiveness. The on-line experiences are aimed at applying the readings, obtaining hands-on experience in analyzing data, and developing reporting skills. Each Unit lists supplementary readings and weblinks where you can find additional information to explore the topic in greater depth. The course has linkages to the other courses in the Institutional Research Certificate program. For example, the opening weeks of HI ED 840 expand upon some of the assessment and evaluation readings and materials covered in selected units of the Foundations course (HI ED 801). Both this assessment course and the course on Studying Students and Student Affairs (HI ED 802) draw upon and discuss relevant literature and theories of student outcomes. Persistence models and theories referred to in these courses are relevant also to Enrollment Management and Forecasting (HI ED 860). The Research Design course (HI ED 830), with its emphasis on measurement issues and survey research, provides an analytical foundation for all these other IR courses. HI ED 840 summarizes the best of what we know about assessing student outcomes. Few topics are more complicated than outcomes assessment. The needs of students and the areas of their learning vary highly among institutions and degree programs. Students are diverse and the dimensions of the learning processes in American Higher Education are extremely complex. Likewise, assessing student performance is complex and hence difficult to summarize. Moreover, before we travel into the real content of assessment, we need to place our journey within a context, and within an environment that is heavily shaping what we do. Thus, before we focus on evaluation academic programs and assessing student outcomes, we will examine accountability, accreditation, and performance reporting. In recent years, evidence of student outcomes has become one of the key indicators of institutional effectiveness, especially as it is viewed by accrediting associations and many state higher education governing boards."
HIED 841: Research and Assessment in Student Affairs,"Accreditation bodies, state legislatures, critics, and the public at large continue to challenge colleges and universities to demonstrate what and how students are actually learning. Further, student affairs departments are being scrutinized-both internally and externally-regarding the importance, relationship, and effectiveness of their initiatives for student learning and persistence. This course suggests that research, program evaluation, and assessment are critical skills for student affairs practitioners to develop in responding to such concerns and in order to undertake and accomplish their efforts with excellence. More specifically, this course will help students to contextualize and evaluate student affairs programs with an eye towards effectiveness and improvement."
HIED 843: Foundations of Student Affairs,"This course examines the nature and purpose of the student affairs profession, its functions, and how they can be effectively managed, coordinated, and integrated as part of student learning in American institutions. It also explores institutional strategies for organizing, staffing, and funding the large portfolio of programs, services, and facilities designed to facilitate student learning and development at different types of institutions. Complementing material learned in other HIED courses, this course will explore the practical use of student development theory, student learning assessment, and organizational theory in student affairs."
HIED 849: Legal Issues in Higher Education,"This course is an overview of the legal standards arising in higher education, including institutional legal obligations, the rights and responsibilities of faculty, staff, and students, and the legal and regulatory roles of states and the federal government. The course is intended to serve the needs of students with varied professional and academic interests related to higher education who would benefit from a greater understanding of the legal forces that affect colleges and universities."

HIST 124: History of Western Medicine,"This course explores the history of health, illness, and medicine in western society from Ancient Egypt through the modern world. Relying on both primary and secondary sources, the course examines major developments in the understanding of health, illness, medical treatment, and medical practice in western society from Ancient Egypt to the present. The course will explore such themes as the changing status of medical practitioners, the experience of patients in different historical settings, artistic depictions of illness and healing, and the increasingly prominent role of medicine in public policy in order to better understand the links between medicine and its social, cultural, intellectual, and political contexts."
HIST 125N: History of Infectious Disease and Epidemiology,"Infectious diseases once thought to be nearly eradicated have seen a resurgence in recent years. The majority of the cases arose from people who deliberately chose not to vaccinate their children against these disease. Even in the twenty-first century the nature of disease and how to prevent it is not merely a matter of science, but an issue laden with cultural, political, and religious concerns. This course charts the history of disease both as a subject of scientific inquiry and a cultural and religious phenomenon. We will begin with early Greek and Egyptian attempts to understand disease as a foreign entity attacking the body and end in the twenty-first century with current ideas surrounding the use of antibiotics, vaccines, and emerging threats throughout the world. Along the way we will discuss the impact of significant epidemics - for example, Bubonic Plague, Syphilis, and Influenza - as well as changing scientific thinking of both how to deal with disease and how to understand the natural world. In tandem with the historical background key scientific ideas necessary for studying disease - including current understanding of the microbial world, microscopy techniques, and modern gene theory - will be presented to the students through classroom instruction and virtual laboratories."
HIST 128N: Cultural Perspectives on Mathematics,"This course will investigate the development of mathematical thought in multiple Afro-Eurasian cultures from the Bronze Age through the early medieval period, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, India, China, and the Islamic world. Math will be examined as a cultural product, with specific developments contextualized in the generating civilization's history, socio-political structures, economic systems, artistic and literary movements, and prevailing religious and philosophical ideas. Students will investigate the ways in which specific aspects of a culture influenced the development of specific ideas about, approaches to, and techniques regarding number and mathematical processes. Key themes in this respect will be what social forces encourage the development of practical or theoretical mathematics; how a society determines what is truth; the conception of abstract ideas such as zero and negative, infinite, and irrational numbers; the social status of mathematicians and their relationship with political and social authorities; and what social forces hinder the development of practical and/or theoretical mathematics. Students will also consider how the availability of certain mathematical knowledge enabled the development of particular social systems, architectural achievements, and more. Key themes in this respect will be the mathematical needs of specific political systems (such as the accounting involved in imperial administration), legal systems (such as fair division of goods), and religious systems (such as the calculation of accurate systems of time). At the same time, students will draw connections across time periods and cultures by examining the interactions between civilizations and how those interactions influenced the development of mathematics as a human endeavor. Key themes in this respect will be understanding what political, economic, and other forces cause cultures to come into contact or seek out contact; and how the exchange of knowledge shapes both the receiving culture and the study of mathematics as a whole. As part of this course, students will study both specific mathematical ideas (e.g., number systems, deductive reasoning, geometric algebra, and the motivating problems that spurred development) and the specific ancient and medieval cultures named above."
HIST 129N: Chocolate Worlds,"This course will examine the ""world"" of chocolate throughout human history. First cultivated by the ancient peoples of the Americas and then manufactured by Europeans and Pennsylvanians alike, chocolate has played a privileged role as a luxury good. An interdomain course, ""Chocolate Worlds"" is interdisciplinary, taught by faculty in the departments of Plant Science, Anthropology, and History. As a team we investigate the how diverse societies have differentially interacted with this crop. Rather than be organized chronologically, this course will be divided into course Units, such as the history of cocoa uses and cultivation, cocoa plant science and farming issues, chocolate making and markets, and the state of the global chocolate industry. The course's lectures and assigned readings work in concert equally directed by scientific inquiry and the queries of the social sciences and humanities. Assignments will address real world questions relating to contemporary cocoa cultivation and production, and its role in international development and social justice. As a class we will take field trips to sites such as local chocolate manufacturing facilities and cocoa research sites and laboratories. The learning objectives of this course include students' broad knowledge of cacao production, its history, and ethnical issues surrounding its cultivation in today's global economy. Additionally, students will gain an historical appreciation for the role this crop his played in diverse human societies and a scientific understanding of its genetic structure."
HIST 144: The World at War: 1939-1945,"History 144 provides an in-depth study of World War II, which brought many new aspects to modern warfare: civilians were the majority of casualties, deliberate air attacks were made on cities, research brought the advent of new technologies, and several of the global belligerents represented the participation of militaristic totalitarian states where dictators had risen to power with considerable popular support. Thus, topics of the course include: the origins of the war; political and economic struggles leading to the conflict; actions of both Axis and Allied military forces; broad violence in the forms of rape and genocide; and the aftermath of the struggle."
HIST 145N: The Holocaust and Human Rights,"This inter-domain course integrates historical (GH) study of the Holocaust with sociological (GS) perspectives on the Holocaust and human rights. Topical content begins with historical antisemitism (""the longest hatred"") and elaborates the history of the Holocaust in German and in Europe. A second half of the course explores consequent definitions of genocide and human rights, globally established by the United Nations through international law. Post-war campaigns to reduce prejudice and to raise 'Holocaust consciousness' are presented along with sociological insights into problems of persecution through eugenics, xenophobia, and racialized inequalities. Survivor testimonies underscore the value of resilience and the ethics of standing up against injustice, including discrimination or persecution based on cultural or another group identification."
HIST 147: East European Jewish History,"The study of East European Jewish history, fascinating in its own right, is also key to understanding the lived experience of modernity in a complicated and compelling part of the world. This course will thus seek to examine East European Jewry from the inside and from the outside. We will see how a minority community weathered the storms of modernity, while at the same time noting how their experiences reflect on the broader culture and forces around them. We will look to examine the entire East European Jewish landscape, but with particular attention to Russia and Poland. In addition to the textbooks, we will read articles on economics, culture, politics, gender, religion and literature, as well as reading primary documents. Students who complete the readings and written assignments and participate in class should expect to expand their knowledge of the East European Jewish past as well as enhancing their skills as historians."
HIST 150: America in the 1960s: An Introduction,"This course offers an introduction to the history of the United States in the 1960s. The dual goals of this course are to instill a particular body of knowledge - in this case, America in the 1960s, and to provide students with tools that will help formulate interpretations of this crucial period in U.S. history. Topics covered will include the leadership of John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon; the struggle for civil rights for people of color; the emergence of student movements across the country; the steady escalation of US involvement in Vietnam; shifting relations across gender lines, and particularly the rise of the modern feminist movement; and, finally, the growing influence of popular culture, such as music, literature, and film."
HIST 152: African American History,"Chronological and topical survey of the history of African Americans from the colonial period to the early twenty-first century. This course covers major themes in African American history including the societies and cultures of Africa, the Middle Passage, the Colonial experience, slavery, abolition, and the quest for freedom, Civil War and emancipation, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Great Migration, African American cultural expressions, WWII and the seeds of Civil Rights, the Freedom Movement, Black politics and White backlash. While ""knowing the facts"" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or ""order"" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the relationship between the experiences of African Americans and United States history as a whole. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped African American history. (3) Students will learn how to ""think historically"" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of African American history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Americans. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped African American history and continue to shape the modern United States."
HIST 153Y: The Indian in North America,A survey of the American Indian from prehistory to the present.
HIST 155: American Business History,"This course examines major developments in the history of modern American business and industry from the colonial period to the present. History 155 introduces students to a number of the main themes, concepts, and events comprising American business history. Although the course has a pronounced big business/large corporation focus, it nonetheless provides a broader perspective than simply one of selected corporate histories. Indeed, the course treats the conduct of business as an integral element of American society and culture. Topics to be discussed include the colonial commitment to commerce, the effects of new technologies, the emergence of modern large-scale industrial production and the changes it brought to business management, and the importance of world events and American businesses."
HIST 156: History of the American Worker,A study of the American worker from the preindustrial era to the present.
HIST 157: Railroads and American Society,"HIST157 shows that, without railroads, the United States would not have become the United States. It provides a panoramic view of 200 years, from the earliest rail lines to the current day and shows how the rail industry affected everything, from the economy to daily life. One of the course's central objectives is to demonstrate how these changes were experienced differently by different communities and social groups.. The first half of the course investigates how and why the American rail network was built and how the public and government reacted to the changes it brought. It reviews the financial, geographical, and legal resources needed to build the first rail lines and why they proved to be superior to roads and canals. During and after the Civil War, the building of the transcontinental lines relied heavily on federal aid and the labor of minorities (including African American, Irish, and Chinese). Although many Americans initially embraced the railroad industry, after experiencing improvements in their local economies and lifestyles, many turned against it in the late nineteenth century. Hard economic times turned labor against management, farmers against the industrial centers, nativist Americans against immigrants, and so on. After two decades of protest, the reformers of the Progressive era passed sweeping legislation to regulate the industry. The second half of the course studies how railroads declined during the twentieth century and how government regulations were relaxed. In addition to the challenges of two world wars and The Great Depression, it explores how railroads experienced new economic and technological pressures. These include competition from motor vehicles and airplanes, which led railroads to lose most of their passengers and much of their freight. The change from steam to diesel locomotives brought difficulties for rail communities and rail workers. The course investigates how demands made by labor often served to alienate public opinion. Although streamlined passenger trains briefly regained public enthusiasm, this soon dwindled in the post-WW2 years, as Americans embraced the automobile and the airplane. By the 1970s, railroad troubles were extreme enough to test America's sense of balance between free enterprise and government aid. Despite public criticism, the federal government intervened, to create Amtrak and then Conrail. The final sections of the course investigate how the relaxation of federal regulations led to a partial rail renaissance. It shows how freight service has been a great success but why inter-city passenger service continues to be unattractive to many American citizens and investors."
HIST 158: History of American Immigration,"examines the immigrant experience in North America since 1607. The course explores the various ways in which immigrants of diverse backgrounds experienced life in British North America and the United States, a study that includes an examination of immigration memoirs, policies, responses to immigration, and immigrant culture in different parts of the United States. In addition, the course will critically examine popular representations of immigrants and encourages an analysis of the resulting minority groups, their reception, assimilation, and persisting identity."

HIST 212N: Earthquakes and Human History,"A natural disaster is the result of a natural hazard impinging upon human society. In this course we examine seismicity as a geophysical phenomenon and as a natural hazard that interacts with the built environment and the social structures of human societies. Whenever possible, we approach this subject historically. Among other topics, we examine the history of how earthquakes have been understood as well as the impact of earthquakes and seismicity on the history and development of certain societies. Our specific perspectives include: Earthquakes as understood by modern and contemporary earth science Major conceptions of earthquakes in the past Impacts of seismic hazards on the built environment of past societies Impacts of seismic hazards on politics, economic development and social policies of past societies Seismic hazards, earthquake-related technology, and contemporary societies By examining earthquakes in these ways, the study of earthquakes becomes a vehicle for enhancing skills in analytical reasoning. In particular, this course focusses on applications of modern scientific analysis and the approaches commonly employed in historical investigation. Specific skills addressed in this course include, processing and quantifying information, problem solving using evidence and sound reasoning, and expressing ideas with clarity. Immersion in the study of earthquakes affords an opportunity to think more broadly about how people have dealt with natural disasters in the past and to explore the roles that science, technology, and social policy play in defining and addressing natural hazards in contemporary societies and in the future. Class meetings include lectures, discussions, and in-class activities. We analyze scientific observations that have led to increased understanding of earthquakes, earthquake hazards and risk. We also make extensive use of case studies as concrete examples of different types of earthquakes, the historical evolution of ideas about earthquakes, and the range of social impacts of earthquakes. Reading assignments provide essential background for class sessions."

HIST 220: Global Diaspora and Exile,"Introduction to and survey of the Jewish and other Diasporas around the world.  HIST (J ST) 220 The Jewish and Other Diasporas (3) (GH;IL) The long dominant view that the Jewish experience since antiquity defines Diaspora as a concept has been challenged in recent years. The meaning of the term Diaspora and related terms, especially (ethnic and/or national) identity and (ethnic and/or national) community, is a matter of much debate across disciplines. The longevity and diversity of distinct Jewish communities around the globe make the Jewish case a particularly interesting subject for study. In a wide geographical, chronological and disciplinary comparative sweep, the course will explore the diverse nature of ethno-national and ethno-religious diasporas (and sub-diasporas), their position, their place of origin (""homeland"") and their new surrounding culture and society. More specifically, the course will analyze how Diaspora communities in Europe, Asia, and the Atlantic world reconstituted their identities as they expanded into new environments and encountered other cultures, from antiquity to the present. Emphasis will be placed on exploration of the intersection of politics and culture in respect to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender and class. A key question guiding the discussions will relate to the usefulness and limitations of the Diaspora concept, especially in regard to the discourse about globalization where the term is often used. The course will begin with an extensive discussion of theoretical texts about the Diaspora phenomenon. This is followed by case studies of several larger Diasporas, ranging from the Jewish, the Greek to the Chinese Diaspora. Several case studies, notably the Muslim Diaspora, the concept of a victim Diaspora, or alternative Diasporas highlight the limitations of the Diaspora concept. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches, placing some emphasis on the use of theoretical texts written by historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists. The course includes a one-day field trip to the Lower Eastside in New York (visit of the Museum of Chinese in America, walking tour of the Lower Eastside to explore the history of a key American immigrant neighborhood)."
HIST 252: Revolutions in the Middle East,"The ""Arab Spring"" of 2011 that spread rapidly across the region and featured movements for democratization, social justice, and minority rights collapsed into authoritarian military rule, struggles over the role of political Islam, sectarian and civil violence, massive refugee flight and urban destruction, and outside intervention. This course places the 21st century Middle Eastern revolutions and their aftermath in a broader historical perspective. What were the political, economic, religious, social, and geopolitical factors that contributed to the outbreak of revolution throughout the region? In which ways were these revolutions new, and in which ways were they extensions of earlier, unresolved struggles? How can we understand the distinct trajectories of revolution and counter-revolution across the region? We will focus on several country case studies framed against their late 19th and 20th century histories. The class integrates extensive interdisciplinary and multi-media sources, including novels and memoirs, movies and songs, websites and twitter feeds."

HIST 2H: Western Civilization II,"This honors-level survey examines the history of ""Western"" civilization from the period of Early Modern Europe to the present. The development of social, political, and religious movements in Europe and the development of European colonies around the world had far-reaching, global repercussions. Among the broad developments of this complex period are the creation and collapse of several political and economic global empires, the development of modern nation states, revolutions in technology and industry, and the rise of nationalism, liberalism, socialism, and neoconservatism. The variety of sources used in this course will aid students in learning how to understand and interpret history and in encouraging them to develop a critical method by which to evaluate primary and secondary historical sources and to examine the political, religious, economic, and cultural developments of the ""Western"" world in the Early Modern and Modern periods."
HIST 400: Global History of Food and Famine,"This course examines different case studies of agriculture, food production, and food availability in diverse settings to show how access to food and its denial intersects with ethnic and nationalist politics, imperial and colonial encounters, and global asymmetries. The course reveals the close association of food to social and cultural identities and to conflicts in a global history framework. Spanning case studies from the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-nineteenth century to the Russian Famine of early twentieth century to the Bengal Famine of mid-twentieth century, the course focuses on disparity in access to food for social classes. It focuses on discrete social classes (landlords, farmers, labor, women), but also on modernizers, agronomists and scientists, on state, and on global diplomacy and developmentalist perspectives in the post-World War II era to show the embeddedness of food production and consumption in social relations and in emergent political economy contexts."

HIST (J ST) 409Y (RL ST 407Y) European Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Present (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course analyzes major episodes in the history of anti-Semitism and tries to clarify the motives and dynamics involved. It seeks to understand what these episodes have in common and what is unique in each case--is there a single universal, eternal antisemitism? Or are there rather 'anti-Semitisms' each belonging to a unique historical context? Is there a single continuous line of development in anti-Semitism? What is the relationship of a particular anti-Semitism to the national culture in which it originates?We will be reading the major original texts of anti-Semitism from Roman and ancient writers, through early Christian texts and medieval Christian Blood Libels against the Jews, documents of the Spanish expulsion, Lutheran tracts, Voltaire's essays, German philosophical texts from Kant to Marx, Wagner's racial essays, the Protocols of Zion, and documents of Nazi anti-Semitism by Hitler and Streicher. The major part of the grade will depend on a short research paper which will be presented in various drafts, so that the final version represents the culmination of discussion and constructive criticism and advice. This course is a parallel course to J ST/ (Zionist History) and J ST/ (Modern Jewish History). This course will count toward the Religious Studies, Jewish Studies, and History majors and minors in the 400-level category."
HIST 410: Jews in the Medieval World,"Trends in medieval Jewish society under Islam and Western Christendom.  HIST 410HIST 410 Jews in the Medieval World (3) (US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The Jews lived in widely scattered communities under Christian and Islamic rule in the medieval period. This course will examine how Jews adapted the traditions they developed in Palestine and Babylonia in the early centuries C.E. to the new conditions they encountered in Europe and the Mediterranean region from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries. It will focus on the general problem of how traditional societies survive in rapidly changing circumstances, particularly when their members are a minority population. The course will aim at developing students' skills in comparative analysis as they compare the adaptive strategies of Jews in different cultural spheres (the Franco-German region versus Spain, for example). They will also be asked to compare the different polemical stances Jews adopted vis-a-vis Christianity, on the one hand, and Islam, on the other. They will be encouraged to understand the ways in which Jews internalized certain aspects of the majority culture and rejected others. It is hoped that they will come to see how deeply Jewish history was intertwined with medieval Christian and Islamic history, despite inter-religious hostilities and the frequent need for Jews to defend against majority aggression.Students will be evaluated on the basis of two mid-term exams (the first after the survey of the Muslim world, the second after the examination of the Franco-German region) and a comprehensive final exam.The course will be linked to most of the courses taught in the field of Jewish Studies, especially J ST 111 (Early Judaism), J ST 114 (Modern Judaism), and J ST 118 (Modem Jewish History from 1492). It will also be linked to offerings in Religious Studies: RL ST 001 (Introduction to World Religions), RL ST 101 (Comparative Religion), RL ST 107 (Introduction to Islam), RL ST 124 (Early and Medieval Christianity), and RL ST 165 (Introduction to Islamic Civilization).

HIST 465: The Post-World War II Civil Rights Movement,"The civil rights struggle and its impact upon American politics.  /  The Post-World War II Civil Rights Movement (3) (US) This course focuses on the post-World War II Civil Rights Movement. It begins with a discussion of the ""Long Civil Rights Movement,"" briefly looking at the roots of the movement in the labor movement and social struggles of the Great Depression and World War II. We then turn to the impact of World War II on African Americans, the growing militancy during the war, the struggles over segregation in the military, the growing role of blacks in the labor movement, and the growing link between African Americans and the rising anti-imperial movements that accelerated after the war. We discuss the role of African Americans in the Cold War and the struggles over the role of Communism and Socialism in the emerging Civil Rights Movement. The course is broken down into key topics of the movement years: the rise of localized grassroots movements all over the United States that were led by local people who sought to challenge school segregation, political disfranchisement, poor housing conditions, police brutality, and job discrimination. While legal disfranchisement and segregation existed solely in the southern states, the entire country practiced both and black people suffered the consequences universally. Much time is spent on the more famous southern civil rights movement, with discussions of the Emmett Till Murder of 1955; the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the rise of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; and the Little Rock Crisis of 1957. The beginning of the 1960s saw the creation of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and the emergence of key women leaders in the struggle such as Mrs. Ella Baker, Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, Mrs. Rosa Parks, and Mrs. Septima Clark, to name only a few. We discuss key moments in the 1960s, beginning with SNCC and CORE and the Freedom Rides, the SCLC in Birmingham and Albany; the March on Washington, the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer and the murders of Chaney, Goodman, Schwerner, and Medgar Evers; the 1965 Selma to Montgomery March, and the final passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

ASIA (HIST) 484Y History of Chinese Thought (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course examines the historical developments of Chinese thought and its multifarious expressions from ancient times to the eighteenth century. It explores the unique Chinese ways and means of making sense of the world and the human condition by probing China&rsquo;s philosophical and religious traditions. It reveals the conscious life of the Chinese in matters moral, ethical, aesthetic and metaphysical.

HIST 530: History of Science in the Early Modern World,"This course exposes students to the current state of scholarship from the standpoint of historical, legal, sociological, and literary analyses of science in the early modern period. The inadequacy of long-accepted notions of ""science"" and ""modernization"" to describe the rapid changes of scientific thought in the early modern era require students to assess the specific value given to such notions by the state, religion, and society in specific cultural and historical contexts. The seminar will also explore the reconceptualization of society and nature in the early modern period and the way in which discoveries in natural philosophy inspired those changes. The exchanges between European and non-European centers of authority during the early modern period helped to shape many of these disputes and scholars' current interpretive frameworks. In particular, we will challenge triumphal narratives of the Scientific Revolution by examining the ways in which geography and local context affected ideas about the natural world, the role of gender in knowledge-making, and how non-elite and artisanal practices also contributed to the creation of early science. A focus throughout the course will be on how the exchanges between European and non-European intellectual communities shaped contemporary understanding of the natural world. The seminar is intended for graduate students in history and related fields who are preparing for the field in Early Modern studies. The seminar is intended for graduate students in history and related fields who are preparing a field in early modern studies."
HIST 535: History of the Body,"This course provides students with an overview of the contribution of intelectual and cultural historians to the field of ""body history.""  History of the Body (3) This course exposes students to the contribution of intellectual and cultural historians to the field of ""body history."" Ranging from the late medieval to early twentieth century, the course will focus attention on the early modern period. Inspired by the writings of Ernst Kantorowicz, Norbert Elias, Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, and Judith Butler, among others, historians have demonstrated that bodies are not exempt from social, cultural, or ideological regimes of power. As a metaphor for the body politic or an instrument of power, the corporeal order is shown to have physical, social, symbolic, and political effects. As historians continue to demonstrate, the body has a history: which involves health, sickness and food, gestures and movement, sartorial codes and sumptuary regulations, gender taboos and sexual prohibitions. Studies of the body demand a multidisciplinary perspective. Thus, this course explores how historians have drawn upon visual as well as textual sources, and crossed disciplinary boundaries in order to better appreciate the entire range of bodily representations in the past."
HIST 551: The African American Freedom Struggle,"This seminar provides students with an overview of important topics and debates related to the African American Freedom Struggle from Reconstruction to the present. The course is organized chronologically and thematically to highlight the changing and distinctive concerns related to African Americans' efforts to secure the rights and benefits of American citizenship. Special attention is given to the ways in which high politics intersect with grassroots actions. The course considers African American mobilization throughout the entire country and does not simply address the more familiar southern post-WWII struggle. Not only will students gain a critical understanding of some central debates in this field, but also, they will begin to think about how they might teach this material to undergraduates."

Topics will include but are not limited to: Visions of Middle Eastern modernities and the role of colonialism in shaping them; the place of religion and secularization as sites of colonial hegemony or national resistance; popular culture as contested terrain in the colonial era; the various ways the colonial encounter shaped social norms and patterns related to gender and sexuality; and the nature and effects of colonial violence."
HIST 571: Latin American Ethnohistory,"gives students an overview of key literatures, methodologies, and debates in the historiography of Latin American ethnohistory, from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries. ""Ethnohistory"" is defined here as the historical study of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The course comprises four sections, each based on an historical sub-field and its historiography: (1) the indigenous civilizations of the Americas in the pre-Contact and Contact periods, primarily fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including but not necessarily limited to the civilizations of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas; (2) indigenous responses to European invasion, with particular attention to regions of Spanish and Portuguese activity - and including the historiographical development of the New Conquest History, with attention also given to regions where colonies were not established; (3) the indigenous experience of Spanish and Portuguese colonization, and indigenous contributions to new colonial-era societies, including changes and continuities in indigenous civilizations during the colonial centuries - and including the historiographical development of the New Philology); and (4) the indigenous experience of the long Independence period, taking the seminar to a point in the nineteenth century, as determined by the instructor."
HIST 572: Race and Nation in Modern Latin America,"From initial colonial contact, Latin America represents a site of violent conquest by European colonizers over indigenous populations and exploitation of both African and indigenous labor; white control over black and brown bodies was at the very core of colonial economic success or failure. In turn, racial hierarchy and exploitation define both colonial and modern Latin American history. Our focus is not the overall study of race and slavery throughout Latin American history. Instead we will examine the role of race in Latin American nation-building following independence through the age of twentieth century nationalism. As the ideas of scientific racism swept Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century, the United States established economic, and at times military, dominance over much of Latin America from the neo-colonial period of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Increasingly, as cultural and economic ties were broken with the Iberian empires-even in the case of Spain's last American colonies, Cuba and Puerto Rico-Latin American elite sought modernity through trade with and cultural borrowing from the United States and Europe. In response to the scientific racist ideology that in the US led to segregation, Jim Crow, convict lease systems, lynching, and widespread disenfranchisement, Latin American elite consciously engaged these racist ideas as they granted or restricted non-white populations access to their rights as citizens. Nineteenth century luminaries such as Cuban revolutionary José Marti, Argentine journalist and politician Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and even Venezuelan military and political leader Simón Bolívar had introduced radical ideas on race and citizenship. In the first half of the twentieth century Latin American intellectuals famously built on those ideas by embracing, renegotiating, and/or rejecting North American racist ideologies-often all within the same work-as they optimistically and proudly recognized and rehabilitated the place of the nonwhite, indigenous, mestizo, and mulatto populations into their national narratives. We will focus on three of the best known of these authors (Mexican Jose Vasconcelos, Cuban Fernando Ortiz, and Brazilian Gilberto Freyre) as well as scholarship that will help us contextualize their works, and allow us to better understand the broader theme of race in modern Latin America. The object here is to consider how the subject of race-in large part defined by the role of Afro-Latin Americans, the indigenous, mestizo, and mulattos-is situated in relation to broader considerations of nation, power, violence, and identity. The goal of the course is to lay the groundwork for an interdisciplinary understanding of modern Latin America and the modern black Atlantic: To consider the consequences of colonization, slavery, and the slave trade, both historically and contemporarily, on modern intellectual formations and institutions."
HIST 581: Modern China,"Primarily a reading seminar, this course focuses on Chinese history from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, emphasizing the profound ways that the Qing empire, Republican China, and then the People's Republic changed through numerous social, cultural, economic, and political revolutions. In particular, the course investigates transitions from the late imperial period through the Revolution, the Warlord period, the Nanjing Decade, Second World War, the Civil War, and the establishment of the socialist China. Students will examine the changing role of women in Chinese society to the changing relationship of humans to environment, as well as exploring the multiple approaches Chinese historians have taken to reading and presenting historical work, including economic, political, social, and cultural history; social, cultural, economic, and political revolutions; the consolidation of communism; and the impact of successive political movements on China and the Chinese peoples."
HIST 589: World History: Themes and Approaches,"This course provides students with the thematic and theoretical foundation for the study and teaching of world history.  World History: Themes and Approaches (3) This course will provide students with the thematic and theoretical foundation for the study and teaching of world history. Because world history is a crucial secondary field for historians, with increasing emphasis on it as a necessary ""teaching field,"" this course seeks to equip students to teach world history at the undergraduate level. The course will be divided into five primary units, each of which will address a major theme in world history, such as the rise of civilizations, great land empires (particularly the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire), the Silk Road, the spread of world religions, the Mongol invasions, European exploration, the Industrial Revolution, the rise of the nation-state, and globalization (specific units will be determined by the instructor). Within each of these units, students will be exposed to both substantive historical literature on the topic as well as major theoretical works that have influenced historical scholarship. In this way, students will be encouraged to think about the ways historians use theory to frame and inform their scholarship and teaching.

HUM 150N: World Mythologies in the Arts,"This course is an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural, historical, and contemporary examination of myth as it appears in the visual arts, literature, and film. Each iteration of the course covers myths in the arts of at least several of the following cultures-Greek and Roman, Celtic, Norse, European, Egyptian, Near Eastern, Indian, Chinese, Pacific, African, and Native American. The course is thematic and intercultural, for example in the way myths are told in historical cultures and then retold and transformed in art, literature, and films in later cultures. Thus, the course considers in what ways myths are reconceived and altered when they appear in later cultures and in different media within the arts. The course is not a survey of world mythologies, but an interdisciplinary examination of myths and mythic themes and images in the arts (such as painting and film) and literature, with an emphasis on the interpretations and transformative processes applicable to myths as they are (sometimes radically) altered and embodied in art forms that may be far removed in time, place, and meaning from the original contexts of the myths themselves. The course is intended to familiarize students with the ways that different cultures have interpreted the world in which they live-how cultures created their own explanations for phenomena they could not understand, and how contemporary culture gives new life to older myths. The course examines such questions as the meanings of myths as represented in the arts, the various purposes of myths in the arts, such as the functions of creation myths and myths of the hero; theories of how myths originate; and ways that myths have been analyzed, interpreted, and adapted in other cultures through the arts. Students learn to compare and contrast myths in the arts, discuss common elements in myths in the arts, and to interpret the meaning of the myths both within the cultural and historical context in which they were created and the ways they are reinterpreted in later cultures in the arts."

IB 404: Contemporary Issues in International Business,"Investigation of issues in international business practice interpreted from the foundations of the social sciences.  Topics will be chosen from contemporary issues in global business and economics.  I B 404 Contemporary Issues in International Business (3) I B 404 enables students to study the most current topics in international and global business from the framework of the social science issues that form the framework for understanding, business decisions. The course provides structured experiences in library research and data gathering, techniques, and builds the habit of reading the international business press daily and analyzing it weekly. The class is typically organized around 3 integrative business topics that represent a spectrum of questions important to business. These include questions about finance and economics in international business, questions about people and organizations in an international environment, and questions about products (development, production, distribution of goods and services) in international business contexts. This is not an introductory course, and as such, the topics chosen should be substantive and nuanced. For example, one topic might be how the structure of franchises must be modified to reflect the property rights in a particular country, and how those property rights laws impact the value of the franchise. The second topic might be how the internationalization of the structure and role of Boards of Directors in multinational firms contribute to globalization, and challenge the cultural norms in those organizations The third topic might be how North American firms have been forced to adjust their product packaging, in response to environmental impact laws in Germany, and how this shifts the locus of the product message from point-of-purchase to alternative media."
IB 470: International Development in an African Context,"This course looks at international development from an African perspective and discusses the prospects for African economic growth in the 21st Century. With an understanding of historical events that have shaped the political and social landscape of modern day Africa, the economic potential of African nations will be discussed in detail. Utilizing success stories, the course introduces economic, business, social, and political issues that confront developing countries in Africa, along with solutions that have been proposed or are in use to address various development challenges. This course will provide students with the opportunity to learn first-hand about international development issues. It will introduce students to definitions of international development terms, data on international development, measures of development and development indices, as well as leading issues in International development. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course explores some of the key development issues in sub-Saharan Africa, examines empirical findings to better understand Africa and its nations, and reviews the prospects for successful international business in this emerging growth market. Cases studies focus on successful economic growth that have emerged out of Africa and what how these successes are laying the groundwork for future international business opportunities. As such, the various components of the course are designed to promote the student's abilities to: -Describe and analyze social, economic, political elements that influence development in African countries. Students will learn that development problems, while often measured in economic terms, are multi-faceted and interrelated, thereby learn to appreciate that meaningful analysis and problem solving in international development must include different components. -Identify and analyze specific global issues, illustrating the social, economic and political context that may affect their resolution. Students will have the opportunity to experience the different facets of international development and participate, in a limited way, in efforts to address the issues."

IE 584: Time Series Control and Process Adjustment,"Design of Time Series-based process controllers for Quality Engineering. Study of the effect of autocorrelation on control chart performance.  Time Series Control & Process Adjustment (3) With modern sensor technology, quality control data frequently exhibits dynamics due to the short time between observations. Quality specifications keep ""shrinking"", and process drift is less tolerated than before. Under these circumstances, Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques cannot be applied, and the emphasis in quality control moves from monitoring a process to actively adjusting it. Time Series techniques are ideal tools for developing such process adjustment strategies. This course covers topics of recent interest both in academia and in industry, including: integration of feedback adjustment techniques with traditional SPC methods; the ""run-to-run"" control problem as it occurs in discrete-part manufacturing (e.g., semiconductors); and optimal design of proportional-integral and EWMA controllers. In addition, a detailed treatment of statistical identification and estimation of ARIMA and discrete-time transfer function processes is presented. The effect of data autocorrelation on the performance of SPC control charts is discussed, and process adjustment strategies are presented as an alternative. For this reason, ABIMA modeling is discussed in detail as a means to represent data autocorrelation. Use of the MATLAB and SAS software packages are encouraged. A book on the course subject matter is under preparation and has been accepted by John Wiley & Sons who will publish it in its Probability & Statistics Series. Given the heterogeneity of the students taking the course, the prerequisites are rather modest, and the course is almost self-contained. The prerequisite is IE 423, or a similar introductory course in statistical process control."
IE 588: Nonlinear Networks,"Foundation in congestion games, including elements of non-cooperative game theory, equilibrium network flows, Braess paradox, and the price of anarchy.  I E 588 Nonlinear Networks (3) This course examines the theory of congestion games, developed originally to describe flows on congested transport networks but recently embraced to model data networks. Students will learn how to formulate descriptive models of traffic and data network flows in the presence of congestion as Nash games expressed as variational inequalities (VIs). These models will be used to derive theoretical bounds on the price of anarchy (the social costs of not achieving a truly cooperative or system optimal flow). Students will also learn how to formulate normative network design problems and Stackelberg games or so-called mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) to avoid the Braess paradox. Numerical techniques for solving Vis and MPECs will be discussed and illustrated. The course begins with an introduction to so-called system optimal network flow models that explicitly incorporate network congestion. The study of system optimal flows contains an introduction to nonlinear network optimization algorithms, including feasible direction, gradient projection, simplicial decomposition and affine scaling algorithms. Following the consideration of system optimal flows, both atomic and non-atomic network equilibrium models in the form of non-cooperative Nash games are discussed in-depth. The price of anarchy is presented as the ratio of the cost of Nash equilibrium flows to the cost of system optimal flows within the network of interest. Various theoretical bounds on the price of anarchy are derived. Numerical experiments to determine the price of anarchy are also described. The Braess paradox, wherein global congestion can increase when local capacity is added to a nonlinear network, is introduced and its relationship to the price of anarchy demonstrated. Discrete and continuous equilibrium network design models that eliminate any possibility for the Braess paradox to arise are articulated. Each such design model is shown to be equivalent to a Stackelberg game, which is a type of mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC).Mechanism design in the form of network congestion pricing to alleviate the effects of congestion is also considered and show to have an MPEC structure as well. Algorithms for solving MPECs to ascertain efficient network topology/efficient tolling will be discussed in detail, including simulated annealing and other types of computational intelligence on the one hand; and duality, penalty, decomposition and other types of nonlinear programming algorithms on the other. Students interested in taking this course should have completed a course in linear programming (I E 505); a course in nonlinear programming is also recommended."

INTAF 510: Cross Cultural Conflict Resolution,"Across the globe there are more laws and provisions in place to protect human beings from discrimination than at any other time in history and yet there are more incidents of conflict, intolerance, bias, and violence than ever. How are we to make sense of these two competing realities? How can we become ethical leaders in the face of such contrasts and complications? This course combines perspectives from communications, psychology, sociology, political science, law and legal studies, human rights, identity-based studies, media studies, and cultural studies to engage questions of how cultural difference and discrimination play a role in conflict and resolution. Topics to be covered are 1) how societies create inegalitarian categories of identity, 2) how those divisions create conflict, and 3) how those divisions hinder conflict resolution. The course will look at a variety of ways that societies come to categorize forms of human life according to religion, nationalism, patriarchy, ethnic identity, and other forms of social division and stereotyping. One key area we will address is the development of law and other instruments that both protect and disenfranchise vulnerable populations. We will also look at strategies for cross-cultural community development and peace building. The topics will be studied in a cross-cultural context allowing students to consider these issues from a range of global perspectives."

"INTAF 815: Dynamics of International Economic Order: Law, Politics, and Power","This course examines the cross-cutting relationship between political power and global economic governance.  Dynamics of International Economic Order: Law, Politics, and Power (3) This course explores the cross-cutting relationship between political power and global economic governance. It considers how nation-states define international economic order through the creation of legal frameworks and rules-based regimes; how shifts in the international distribution of power impact these frameworks and regimes; and how, in contemporary context, the United States and China approach global economic governance as part of their grand strategies. To ground their engagement, students will appraise philosophical and analytical perspectives on international economic exchange and economic order - mercantilism, liberalism, realism, and institutionalism. They will examine the concept of hegemonic hegemony and debates over whether economic openness requires a hegemon. Against this backdrop, students will investigate the relationship between American primacy and international economic order. They will consider how U.S. primacy and America's strategic aspirations coming out of World War II shaped the postwar economic order with regard to multilateral trade liberalization (the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) and monetary relations (the Bretton Woods gold exchange standard). They will evaluate challenges to America's vision of postwar economic order posed by Asian developmentalism and ""mercantile realism."" Likewise, they will assess the OPEC revolution, the American/Western response thereto, and the impact of these developments on the international economic order. Students will continue examining the relationship between American primacy and international economic order by reviewing interpretations of economic globalization as a recasting of the original, post-World War II pax Americana. They will look at how reconstituting American primacy through globalization affected multilateral trade liberalization (the World Trade Organization), monetary relations (the post-Bretton Woods dollar standard), and financial liberalization. They will also evaluate competing visions of post-9/11 American primacy - liberalism, neoconservatism, and realism. Students will then turn to the impact of China's rise on international economic order.

"INTAF 853: Engineering, Law, and Policy Systems","This course provides a broad exploration of the relationship between engineering, policy, and law. From driverless cars to AI-powered systems, engineering is transforming public and private spaces. As these new technologies leave the lab and operate in new spaces, each new technology represents a system within that larger, higher-order system. The transformation of these spaces and the interaction of these once-separate systems will be shaped by, and in turn will shape, the public policies of local, state, national, and global policymaking systems. This interdisciplinary course has two objectives. First, it considers the classic engineering problem of integrating subsystems into a larger, higher-order system. In this class, the larger system includes not only other physical systems in the operating space, but also social, legal, and political systems. Second, it considers traditional legal and policymaking institutions as constrained optimization problems. This course identifies the legal and political constraints engineering solutions must satisfy in order to come online."

IT 240Q: Artistic Patronage in Europe,"This course surveys the institutions and social networks in which European fine arts were created, consumed and critiqued. Beginning with the medieval period and ranging to the early 20th century, the course will examine the variety of communities where public and private often intersected and which sponsored innovations in the arts. Often indexing social movements and political change, such communities include convents and cathedrals, royal academies and courts, coffee houses, salons, and theaters. Artists, performers, patrons, politicians, journalists, and others collaborated and competed in these spaces. Such communities could embody political and economic power, or foster resistance to it. This approach to the history of the arts in western culture puts the focus less on the individual creative genius of great composers, writers, painters, and sculptors, and more on the social exchanges and institutions that sponsored and received their work. Such an approach brings to light particularly the ways in which women played significant roles in the production and reception of culture: as salon hostesses, patronesses, and divas, women often enabled and enacted cultural production. Some examples of particular units of study might include: the German convent of Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), where monophonic chant and allegorical morality plays developed; the Mantuan (Italy) court of Isabella d'Este ,the first lady of the world, (1474-1539) where the roots of the madrigal began and where notable painters found support and sponsorship; the French salons of Mme. Geoffrin (1699-1777) and Mme. de Staël (1766-1817); and the student residences in Madrid where avant-garde writers and artists interacted. Each unit will also consider the relationships between the aesthetic norms and values of a period and the economic and political realities of sponsorship. The course will require that students attend at least one musical performance or concert held on campus during the semester and complete a brief writing project based on that experience. This requirement will encourage students to think about their own university as a contemporary space of cultural sponsorship."

JAPNS 426: Early Modern Japan,"Japanese history from 1580-1880.   (, ) Early Modern Japan (3) Japan's Tokugawa period can be difficult to grasp. It resembles a modern society in many respects but operated according to a logic of social organization different from that of most modern states. There was a collective sense of national identity, but its characteristics differed significantly from modern forms of Japanese identity. Moreover, modern ideologies have contributed to the characterization of early modern Japan as a rigid society and of the country as a whole having been isolated from the rest of the world. The main purpose of this course is to afford students the opportunity to study early modern Japan in detail and, insofar as possible, on its own terms. Through readings in primary and secondary sources, and through the evaluation of visual images, this seminar-style course will deepen students' knowledge of Japan and serve as basis for comparative study of other early modern societies. Although the course investigates classic areas of historical study such as institutional development and foreign relations, the emphasis is on social and environmental history. The course encourages students to think about a range of approaches to the past and to think about the ways our contemporary biases influence the ways we understand the past."

This course is intended to provide an introduction to the political, social, economic, and cultural life of the Heian court of ancient Japan. The goals of the class are not only to gain an understanding of a time and place far removed from our own, but also to develop the skill of building such an understanding through primary and secondary sources, both written and visual. Students in this class will take on the role of historian or literary critic themselves, thinking critically about assigned texts and making their own interpretations of their meanings. Through reading, discussions, and writing, students will enhance their ability to think critically and to express their ideas clearly in both speech and writing. The course is intended to deepen student's appreciation of the cultural production of ancient Japan, to help them understand value systems that may differ from those predominant in western cultures, and to assist students in developing both analytic and expressive abilities.

JAPNS 433: Traveling Voices,"Transnational Writings of Japan: from Modern to Contemporary Eras .  () Traveling Voices (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Through literary and visual texts from modern to contemporary eras, this seminar-style course will explore a wide range of narrative voices of Japan, created by writers who are physically or figuratively dispersed in many directions within, towards, and away from Japan, and who therefore problematize ""Japanese-ness"" by dealing with cultural situations (e.g. identities, marginality) in their writings. Some Prior Study of Japan (, JAPNS 121, or ) is required. Students will explore the rich cultural diversity in Japan and the Japan diaspora, and develop a further understanding of historical border crossers between Japan/East Asia and Americas/the West.They will become more aware of the reciprocal and transformative cross-cultural interactions in languages, literature, religions, economics, ideas, or political formations.They will learn how to think critically, in speech and writing, and develop writing analytic skills appropriate to their final paper project. Evaluation will depend on specific instructor practice, but will certainly emphasize guided discussions, some student presentations (alone or/and group), and writing exercises (especially final research project). A sample guideline might look like this: Class Participation/discussion, Response papers, Informal Presentation (pair or group up to three), Mid-term exam, Final paper presentation, Final Project"
JAPNS 450: Introduction to Classical Japanese,"Basic patterns and structures of Classical Japanese from its development in the 6th century through usage in the 20th century.   Introduction to Classical Japanese (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course is an introduction to the basic grammar and stylistic idiosyncrasies of classical Japanese (bungo). Students will be guided through an examination of key syntactical structures and will be asked to apply their knowledge in order to read, translate, and discuss various texts from the classical, medieval, and early modern periods. In addition to gaining familiarity with standard reference materials (such as dictionaries of classical Japanese), students will also gain a working knowledge of the styles and themes of major works of pre-modern Japanese literature. Successful completion of this course will give students the fundamental skills necessary to read texts composed prior to the 1900's and to engage in research in the field of pre-modern Japanese studies. With this training and knowledge concerning the development of the Japanese language, students will increase their proficiency in modern Japanese and their overall knowledge of Japanese culture and literature.Prior study of modern Japanese is required (with proficiency equivalent to successful performance in JAPSN 402).The purpose of the course is to make bungo (literary Japanese) accessible to as many students as possible. Classical Japanese first appeared in the 6th and 7th centuries and was used to write a wide variety of texts up until the mid-20th century. Knowledge of it is very useful to anyone interested in studying Japanese history, literature, philosophy, politics, art, or culture. The course offers a systematic introduction to the grammar of Classical Japanese, while also presenting Classical Japanese and Modern Japanese as part of a linguistic and cultural continuum."

JST 118: Modern Jewish History,"Modern Jewish history is a complex and fascinating story. Some scholars depicted it as a long period of suffering and isolation that culminated in the Holocaust and only ended with the founding of the state of Israel. In recent decades a more balanced perspective has found wide acceptance. Today scholars highlight Jewish agency and different conditions in the various places Jews settled without downplaying anti-Jewish prejudice and violence. A recurring theme in this course concerns the relationship between individual Jews and Jewish communities, and on a broader level, the perception and treatment of Jews by societies and states. As Jews in Western and Central Europe ""left the Ghetto"" around 1800 and became citizens of states, they redefined their relationship to Jewish communities in strikingly different ways. Some Jewish women and men emerged as agents of change, others resisted change. We will explore Jewish ""responses to modernity,"" ranging from assimilation, Zionism, and socialism to migration. While many Jews in Western Europe and the United States prospered, the lives of Jews (and their neighbors) in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire were shaped by social and economic crisis (albeit not constantly and not everywhere). For the twentieth century the course will concentrate on three major events that had a dramatic impact on Jews, especially in Europe: the First World War and the collapse of the large multiethnic Empires in Eastern Europe, the Holocaust and the founding of the first modern Jewish state, Israel."
JST 128N: The Holocaust in Film and Literature,"This class studies how art, literature, film, and other media can help us to gain a perspective on one of the most horrific events in human history, the Holocaust: the genocidal murder of more than six million men, women, and children (mostly Jewish) under the Nazi regime during World War II. We will also examine the theoretical questions involved in any attempt to capture what appears to be beyond our comprehension, in terms of moral outrage and the sheer scale, inhumanity, and bureaucratic efficiency. To this end we will study literary works, such as Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz, films such as Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, Roman Polanski's The Pianist, and Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful, as well as photographs, poems, artworks, installations, museum architecture, the design of monuments and other artifacts. We will also examine questions of memorialization (Holocaust museums and memorials), national guilt, survivor's guilt, stigmatization, and the ethics of historical representation."
JST 210: Numismatics and the Historian,"Numismatics--the scholarly study of coins and medals--is a major tool in the study of Classical history and archaeology.  CAMS (J ST) 210 Numismatics and the Historian (3) (GH;IL) WHY STUDY NUMISMATICS? Numismatics is the scholarly study of coins. Coinage has been used in the ancient world since the 7th century BCE. Eventually, minted money- i.e. coinage- came to supplant money in other forms, replacing barter as the primary means of exchange in economies around the world. Coinage became a tool of governments to impose taxation upon their subject peoples, and to spread propaganda about governmental goals or issues. Coins are works of art, but they are common, widely circulating ""works of art"" which also accomplish a daily monetary function to run commerce and the monetary system of an economy. Coins are also historical records, containing valuable information for the historian who is attempting to reconstruct the history of another time or place. For archaeologists, coins sometimes are the only means of providing absolute dates for excavated strata. The interpretation of numismatic evidence, like any other pieces of evidence in the historical puzzle, however, requires special knowledge and expertise.This course is not a course in ""coin collecting"", although the collector may find the course helpful or interesting. It is an investigation of the development of coined money in the ancient world, with special investigations into (1) how coins were struck and used in Phoenicia of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE; (2) the variety and early uses for coins in the Greek city states of the 6th-4th centuries BCE; (3) the development of Jewish coins in the Holy Land, from Persian times to the period of the 2nd Revolt (early 2nd century CE); and (4) the development of coinage in the Roman economy of the 1st-5th centuries CE.Photographs of coins will enhance class work. With the cooperation of the Palmer Museum, on Penn State's University Park Campus, the class will have access at several points during the semester to view and work with coins from the Palmer's collection of ancient Jewish coins Students will leave the course with a new understanding of what coins are, how they developed, and what they can teach us about ancient history and economics."
JST 426: Holocaust,"This course is an in-depth study of the history of the Holocaust in Europe that puts special emphasis on primary sources.  /  Holocaust (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The Holocaust stands out as the most terrible and challenging phenomenon of the 20th Century. Societies and the scholarship struggled for decades to fully grasp how much the Holocaust has questioned widely shared assumptions about modernity and progress. This course pursues the overarching question how the Holocaust could have taken place. Who were the perpetrators, victims and bystanders? How much agency did they have? How was the Holocaust organized? The course will encourage students to critically engage with the Holocaust, and will consider a variety of different kinds of sources and means of representation, including oral testimony, film and fiction, as well as more conventional documentation. After discussing some of the most important studies about the Holocaust and identifying the main historiographical debates, students will look at the origins and the evolution of the ""Final Solution."" The class will touch on the function of the ""Ghettos,"" the role of the mobile killing units, the extermination camps, and Jewish resistance. The course will also deal with Jewish responses to the Holocaust, notably with attempts to enable Jews to emigrate to safe countries; with efforts to alert the public to the systematic killing after 1940; and the support especially of American Jews for Jewish survivors and DPs. Apart from discussing the historiography, students will work mostly with primary sources. Students are expected to do extensive reading for this class and prepare oral presentations on their respective paper topic. The research paper for this course will be based largely on primary sources. Apart from discussing the historiography, the sessions will concentrate on the interpretation of primary sources: - documents created by the perpetrators, bystanders, and victims; - files relating to postwar trials of perpetrators; - photographs; - representations of objects relating to the Holocaust; - memoirs by survivors; - interviews with survivors and bystanders."
JST 432W: Gender and Sexuality in the Bible,"This writing intensive course will examine issues of gender and sexuality in the Bible, including the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the Deuterocanon, and the New Testament. It will introduce students to a variety of academic approaches to the Bible with respect to a broad range of topics. These topics include: gender identity, sexual orientation, sex, marriage and divorce, adultery, monogamy and polygyny, same-sex relations, chastity and celibacy, prostitution, gender violence, pornography, fertility, procreation, abortion, divine gender and sex, incest, and many others. In covering these themes, the course will deal with some of the most challenging and often disturbing stories and passages in the Bible, the ancient library of books that is sacred to Jews and Christians and which has otherwise greatly influenced civilization for more-or-less two thousand years. Alongside a close reading of the text (philology), this course will employ historical and literary criticism, investigations into ancient material culture (archaeology), modern theoretical interpretive approaches, reception theory, and other methodologies to examine not only the biblical writings in their ancient contexts, but their interpretation and use throughout history to construct social norms."
JST 443: Jewish Histories of the Middle East,"Jews have been part of Middle Eastern societies for thousands of years. They flourished at times and endured hardships at others, but they have been part of every significant social and cultural transformation of the Middle East. In this class, students will discuss the significant contribution of the Jewish community to the development of various Middle Eastern societies throughout the centuries. Students will critically read and analyze primary sources and secondary literature. We will delve into national historiographies of places such as Morocco, Egypt, and Iran-to name a few-and seek to discover a nuanced narrative of Jewish histories of the region. We will also analyze popular culture products, such as documentaries, television, and literature. The course will follow a chronological and thematic order, and will examine Jewish history in conjunction with global and interregional processes in the Middle East and beyond, such as colonialism, imperialism, nationalism, relations with the West, the formation of the modern nation states of the Middle East, and the Israeli-Arab conflict."

JST 4: Jewish and Christian Foundations,"This course seeks to help students better understand the Bible and appreciate its role as an authoritative collection of sacred texts for Jews and Christians. The Bible is a difficult book, one that is demanding on many levels. In order to read the Bible intelligently, it is important to understand the historical and cultural backgrounds of the biblical writings. This course explores the history and geography of ancient Near Eastern civilizations that shaped the experience of ancient Israel and, later, the Greek and Roman imperial contexts that shaped Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. The focus of the course, however, is on the biblical narrative itself and the particular ways that the story of Israel and its covenant with God was represented in scripture: in tales, poems, hymns, dialogues, and genealogies. A basic goal of the course, then, is to promote intelligent, well-informed reading of the Bible. Also important is the willingness to read the Bible closely and critically, with a view toward larger questions raised by biblical texts: how is God to be known and understood? What is the purpose of human life in the world? What moral obligations ought to structure our common life? Does human history have direction and purpose? What is the good and how do we follow it? The Bible takes up these questions and many more. Though an ancient anthology shaped by the succession of Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman empires, the Bible is not merely a product of its original contexts. Millennia of transmission and interpretation have made it a product of history in a much more extended and dynamic sense. In this course, we will examine larger questions raised by the biblical writers and consider the ways that the Bible has shaped, informed, and guided Jewish and Christian ways of life."

The topics chosen for these seminars will introduce students to some of the major figures, historical, literary, religious, and sociological developments in Jewish Studies. By concentrating on these topics, the students will better understand the cultural assumptions of different groups and societies. Although the course will focus on a specific topic, the instructor will aid the student in seeing the larger implications of the issues and controversies discussed in the class. The international and intercultural aspects of the topic will consistently be considered. The course will require students to express their ideas as well as to gather information through research, discussion, and writing. It will consistently challenge students to consider social behavior, the nature of the community, and the value of scholarly work as these relate to the particular topic of the seminar. The course fulfills the first-year requirement, as well as one of the humanities requirements in general education or a Bachelor of Arts humanities requirement. The first-year seminar will be offered twice per year with an enrollment limit of 20 per section."

KINES 430W: Groups in Physical Activity,"During involvement in this course, students will be acquainted with how exercisers and athletes interact with the others within small group environments. Notably, athletes and exercisers are commonly structured into tight-knit, interactive, and interdependent groups such as teams, fitness classes, family units, peer groups, neighborhoods, and training groups. These small groups are fundamental to sport and exercise experiences, while also influencing whether or not youth and adults derive value from physical activity. Therefore, identifying and promoting optimal small group environments is a central goal for researchers studying the social psychology of sport. Whereas the construct of group cohesion is the most widely-studied aspect of small groups in this context, rich and emerging lines of research reveal a great deal about group structures (e.g., norms), emergent states (e.g., social identities), and group processes (e.g., teamwork), as well as the outcomes of involvement in groups. This area of research is of general theoretical interest, but is also critical to establish an enhanced practical understanding for fields ranging from coaching to health promotion, education, and psychology. To explore these group processes, the goal of the course entails establishing a foundational understanding of small group dynamics. From this foundation, class members will explore contemporary research and theory about optimizing sport groups (i.e., sport adherence and performance) and physical activity groups (i.e., physical activity maintenance, positive psychosocial perceptions). This exploration will demand that students read and discuss empirical research - demonstrating the capacity to interpret and understand this literature, along with the capacity to critically appraise empirical findings. Students' learning related to group dynamics will be cemented through discussions and activities focused on real-life groups, as well as demonstrations of group processes using group tasks. By the completion of the course, students will have acquired strategies to optimize small group environments and developed skills to communicate group dynamics constructs and theories. Regarding communication, a critical outcome of this writing-intensive course is the capacity to interpret writing from group dynamics experts and communicating these themes through one's own effective writing."

LARCH 125: Landscape Architecture Orientation Seminar,"Introductory seminar involving readings on significant issues in landscape architecture. LARCH majors only.  Landscape Architecture Orientation Seminar (1)  is a seminar course, the first of many in an entering student's Penn State career. Seminar classes offer the opportunity to read, think, share ideas through informal discussion, and refine personal thoughts reflection. The seminar is a common and useful tool to explore important ideas and develop critical thinking skills. The design and theory sequence begins with the freshman seminar, , which introduces students to landscape architecture issues.In this seminar students read and discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by contemporary landscape architects. To support student explorations, the class undertakes a series of readings of seminal works in landscape architecture and allied field that students carefully consider, question, and discuss. As a major part of student evaluation, they maintain a journal of their evolving ideas about the course content. Entering landscape architecture majors sometimes have a restricted notion of the wide variety of career directions that face them within the field of landscape architecture. This class proposes that the principal role of the landscape designer and planner is to make ""place""; - a combination of physical, cultural and compositional cues that imbue built and natural forms with meaning. The goal of this first-year seminar class is for students to understand the type, or types, of place that landscape can be. The course introduces students to concepts of landscape as place, and asks them to ponder, explore, and respond to ideas about various perspectives on landscape ""place""; This introduces them to the broad range of issues and activities that are addressed in the seemingly simple term, landscape architecture. Course Objectives: a) To become familiar with important issues in contemporary landscape architecture. b) To exercise and hone skills in critical thinking. c) To exercise and hone skills in speaking and writing persuasively. d) To begin to explore roles as future place makers."
LARCH 145: Ecology and Plants I,"introduces students to plants, their ecological context, threats to ecosystems and the various roles that landscape architects play in the design of healthy ecosystems. Plants are central to landscape architecture. On the one hand, plants are one of the primary form-giving components in the landscape architects' palette. At the same time, plants occupy a central place in the ecosystems with which landscape architects interact on all scales of intervention in the landscape. The course is divided into two parts. The first introduces the concepts of plant communities and ecosystems through lectures while providing an introduction to identifying specific native and ornamental, woody and herbaceous plants through field observation - most within their ecological context. The second part of the course consists of lectures introducing the essential roles that landscape architects play as they interact with ecosystems in the landscape at a variety of scales. Here, students are introduced to ecosystem disturbance, the water cycle, issues related to water in the urban landscape, restoration ecology, ecological restoration, and landscape ecology. Finally, students are presented with a series of case studies that demonstrate how landscape architects, with allied professionals, work to apply ecological principles in build design projects. Knowledge gained in  will be applied throughout the remainder of the landscape architecture curriculum."
LARCH 222: Design Theory Seminar,"Inquiry-based reading and discussion of design theory literature relevant to the focus and content of LARCH 212.   Design Theory Seminar (1)  is the companion seminar to the design studio LARCH 212. The seminar is a small group setting where directed readings, independent research and reflection are employed to explore the context of contemporary design. Topics in  reflect the projects being explores in the companion studio but, in general, move beyond exploration of basic design concepts to include an emphasis on both natural and cultural elements of place and provides essential background to the processes and principles of site analysis in as much as those reflect the technological and cultural biases that are brought to design.Landscape architectural principles and issues relevant to the design topics being pursued in LARCH 212 are introduced through studies of design precedents, corollary readings in the sociological, psychological, and cultural contexts of design and small-group discussions - the latter frequently related to topics under investigation in the companion studio, LARCH 212. As the curriculum progresses, the issues explores become increasingly complex and build upon prior seminars.The seoncd-year theory seminar content is introductory in nature. The spring semester () continues to cover introductory writings addressing the broadset principles of landscape design processes, discussions of fundamental ordering principles, and philosophical positions on the interrelationships of landform, plants and structure - increasingly in the context of the design types being explores in LARCH 212. They introduce place-awareness through concepts derived from sociology, social psychology and cultural anthropology.Course Objectives: - To increase familiarity with important issues in contemporary landscape architecture. - To continue to develop skills in critical thinking. - To continue to build skills in speaking and writing persuasively. - To bring focused attention to the issues that impact the design of small, private and public spaces."
LARCH 245: Ecology & Plants II,"This course applies knowledge gained in  by emphasizing planning and design based upon a systems approach to plants, soil and water. The course consists of lectures, campus walks, guest lectures and one day-long field trip to a public garden. The lectures and campus walks focus upon the identification of native plants in the landscape. Guest lectures cover additional, related topics. Students learn about specific native plants and plant communities as the basis for ecological planting design in reference to the ways these plants adapt to local climate, soil and hydrologic regimes. The use of native plant communities in planting design as practiced in this course also promotes the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and the promotion of human wellbeing. It can minimize the use of fertilizer, irrigation, and costly maintenance regimes. Students are also introduced to landscapes that have been shaped by the interactions between people and their environment. The use of native plant communities can be part of the preservation and re-creation important vernacular and historic cultural landscapes.

LGWR 530: Chinese Labor Rel,"Since it opened its economy to private investment in 1978, China's planned economy has been turned into a market-driven economy. Relying heavily on export-oriented industries, China serves as a 'spatial fix' for Western capital, which eagerly searches for new sites of investment and business opportunities. As a result, China has become a gigantic manufacturing hub and the second largest economy in the world. The massive inflow of foreign investment, the pro-business developmental strategies of the Chinese state, and weak legal enforcement of workers' rights have rendered workers victims of economic reform. This course will examine labor relations in post-socialist China. It will cover topics such as the development of China's economic reform, the employment and working conditions of workers, trade unions and the collective bargaining system, the state's role in employment relations, the labor law system, and the role of civil society and non-governmental organizations in the country's labor relations. In addition to China, this course will focus on Vietnam (another post-communist country in Asia), and Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea (three of the four Asian Tigers).

LLED 215N: Children's Picture Books as Multimodal Texts,"Children's picture books are often described as fundamental in nurturing the development of young children into engaged readers and fearless writers. Many adults have a special place in their hearts for picture books they loved as children; books they read over and over again, books that spoke to their hearts and minds, and books that helped them figure out the mystery of written language. In this inter-domain course, we will take a close look at children's picture books and explore their magic though integrating humanities and the arts. We will read many, many books of different genres to examine how the written text and illustration work together to compose a work of art that we read, understand, enjoy and connect to. We will explore the criteria by which we judge the literary and artistic quality of picture books and will become acquainted with resources that can help us find exceptional books. We will also consider the significance of children's literature representing diverse perspectives and will work to deconstruct the values and biases implicit in texts written for young children. Much of the course will be organized in a workshop format through which we will learn about the authoring and illustrating techniques and processes used by notable authors and illustrators of modern children's picture books, while also experimenting with the same techniques through drafting and developing our own picture books. Our end goal will be to thoughtfully weave linguistic and visual composition elements to craft original multimodal texts for children."

LLED 400: Teaching Reading in the Elementary School,"Introduction to the reading program; acquaintance with materials and techniques; observations of reading instruction; correlation with human growth and development.  Teaching Reading in the Elementary School (3)  is intended to help teacher candidates become knowledgeable users of theory and about language, literacy and culture; and to think through instructional problems thoroughly, using multiple sources of information to experiment with alternative solutions. Dealing specifically with reading, we recognize that text goes beyond print texts to include multimodal visual, auditory, digital, movement, and artifactual texts. In , candidates learn to understand how children develop as readers and users of literacies in and out of school. Candidates learn how to teach in ways that support children's successful development and uses of multiple kinds of literacy, including reading. Literacy teaching is both an intellectual and practical matter in which teachers work with students in ways that recognize the complexities of language and its social uses, learning and its cultural contexts, and schooling as organizational phenomena. Children enter schools with multiple types of literacy knowledge and cultural experiences. Coming to understand these complexities requires the coordination of both theoretical awareness and applied knowledge. Candidates' practice is developed as they learn to address the puzzles children present as they construct their knowledge of language, literacy, and literature in various social situations. Developing practical strategies to teach literacy requires a dedication of head, hand, and heart to treat all people with dignity, acknowledging the contributions of all cultural groups and respecting diversity as it honors ideals of social justice. In , teacher candidates develop a repertoire of organizational, instructional, and evaluative strategies that are based on research and best professional practices. Candidates work on projects independently and in collaborative groups. Content is presented by the instructor through a combination of lectures, weekly readings and reflections on readings, class discussion, activities and demonstrations, and viewing and analyzing video. Projects include an analysis of children as readers and curriculum planning. A field experience connected to  and  affords teacher candidates the opportunity to inquire about children's encounters with literacy in elementary grade classrooms.  is part of a block of courses in a PSU teacher education program that is unified by the basic set of principles supporting the development of a broader and more inclusive understanding of texts, children, and communities."

We begin the semester by asking the ""big"" normative questions of innovation: what kinds of technology are we building? What engineering and ethical principles are we applying? Is this ""progress""? How is law helping (or not helping)? Next, using case studies of ""hot topics"" in technology policy, we apply these ideas to current debates. Finally, through the development of an interdisciplinary team project, the lessons from the first two parts of the class are applied, and as the culminating experience of the Master of Engineering program in Engineering, Law and Policy (MELP), engineering students will apply and integrate their knowledge on strategic science and technology policy, regulatory concepts, and systems thinking to the real world policy issue chosen for the team project. The projects are tailored to meet the current research needs of particular federal and state lawmakers and agencies based on their legislative and regulatory agendas for the year. .Students will analyze technology and policy options and conceive, design, and execute a technology and policy research project, taking into consideration the political, social, and institutional context of technological systems. The deliverables of the course will be a formal oral presentation of the team project, a public-facing technology tool, and a policy research paper written for relevant policymakers, seeking to assist them in their policy decision-making process. This will require students to reconcile the engineering and technical realities and constraints of the projects as well as the legal implications, stepping into the shoes of a policymaker. Possible policy coverage and project areas include connected health; consumer/ investor protection in security and privacy; disinformation, governance, and tech literacy; internet availability and net neutrality; sustainability and ethics in computing design; the Internet of Things and the right to repair; machine learning/ AI suitability; tech competition; computing history; and tech workforce development."

LTNST 226: Latina  and Latino Border Theories,"English 226 will constitute a wide-ranging examination of contemporary texts (1960-present) central to the construction of contemporary Latino/a culture.   Latina and Latino Border Theories (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course focuses on contemporary Latina/o cultural production, placing it in historical context and analyzing it through the framework of borders. We make connections between Latina/o groups, showing both similarities and differences. We examine the politics of representation, asking how artistic texts define community and individual identities that are coherent yet also embody the complexity of these identities. The texts cross and claim borders- cultural, sexual, gender, geographical, generational, spiritual, and institutional. We will ask how these art forms work to claim border spaces: How are cultural differences retained without constructing hierarchies of exclusion? What models of identity do these artists propose in response to structures of domination? We'll read novels, short stories, poems, history, and theoretical essays; we will also watch several films. Throughout the course, we will attend to particular histories and cultures of Latina/o groups; it is crucial to both maintain the specificity of each culture (Chicana/o, Puerto Rican, Cuban-American, and Dominican-American) and their connections to each other as Latinas/os in the U.S. Inquiring into these intersections leads one to ask the following: how can Latinos unite against the assault on immigrants and bilingual education without erasing very important differences among Latina/o populations? How can Latinas unite against ongoing sexism and homophobia within their communities and the U.S. in general? How should we view the marketing category ""Hispanic"" and/or ""Latino"" and how do artists offer alternative conceptions of group identity?"

Furthermore, the student gains valuable writing experience in preparing concise and effective technical reports.Lectures, videotapes, and demonstrations are used to introduce students to fundamental concepts and special techniques used in metallography and microstructural analysis of metals. The course begins with a brief overview of metallography and a discussion of safety in the laboratory. Elements of good technical report writing are introduced. Metallographic principles are presented using reference brochures and videotapes. This includes sectioning, mounting, coarse grinding,fine grinding, rough polishing, final polishing and microetching. Added topics cover the fundamentals of metallographs and photomicrography.A review of the iron-iron carbide system is given based upon material presented in MAE T 201 taught in the third semester of the materials program. Supplementary material on copper alloys is introduced latter in the course so that the physical metallurgy of brass and bronze can be better grasped by the student.This course has three laboratory experiments: (1) specimen preparation and optical microscopy, (2) characterization of powdered metal (P/Nl) iron and carbon steel alloys, and (3) characterization of wrought brass, wrought bronze, and sintered bronze alloys. Each experiment requires that the students prepare a technical report that is graded for its grammar, spelling, technical accuracy, and completeness. The student gains valuable experience in preparing metallographic specimens and appreciates the importance of achieving a representative structure. Laboratory work requires observing and interpreting microstructures of both wrought and porous P/N4 iron and carbon steel alloys. Quantitative metallography is used by students to estimate the carbon content of a selected P/M carbon steel alloy. Special metallographic techniques are learned for preparing porous P/1/4 alloys to reveal their true pore structure. The student develops experimental skills in measuring the density P/M samples and the surface hardness of polished metallographic samples. Also, experience at identifying microconstituents in non-ferrous based alloys is of particular value to the student. The technical reports require the presentation of Rockwell hardness and Knoop microhardness data in the form of tables and graphs."

The course will systematically explore mathematical ideas and tools used to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical scenario. Typically this process will begin with an experiment either demonstrated in the W. G. Pritchard Lab or performed by the students in class.Once a particular model has been developed, students will use mathematical analysis and experimentation to determine the properties and relevance of the model, and to make predictions. Often the model can be satisfactory; however, many times one also finds new features of the system that are not adequately accounted for in the model, and the process begins again. It is this cycle the course will focus on. For a given phenomenon (e.g., flow of viscous fluid, pendulum motion) several models may be compared and contrasted, and possible simplifications will be discussed.A significant aspect of the course is its laboratory component, in which the students will perform experiments or observe demonstrations. However, the main emphasis will be placed on creating and rigorously analyzing the mathematical aspects of the models. Instead of presenting a finely tuned model for a given phenomenon, this course will try to convey some of the heuristic, intuitive, and mathematical ideas employed in modeling.Examples of physical systems to be considered include: simple and compound pendulum motion, chemical oscillations, water waves, and elastic behavior of polymer solutions.The course is open to a wide range of undergraduate as well as graduate students with majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics.

METEO 426: Inside Numerical Weather Prediction Models,"will provide students with a practical understanding of the structure of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in the context of their application to real world precipitation forecasting. The course combines lecture material on the inner workings of NWP models with a forecasting module that applies the lecture material to daily precipitation forecasts. The course begins with a full description of the mathematical backbone of NWP models - the primitive, or governing, equations. The primitive equations that describe the future state of the atmosphere, given some initial state, are a set of non-linear, partial differential equations that are only solvable by numerical methods. The sophistication of numerical methods, in turn, depends on available computing capacity. A discussion of the historical development of simplified NWP models in the context of limited computing resources follows. While the advent of modern computers allowed for the explicit computation of the primitive equations, their use in operational forecast settings uncovered additional important theoretical limitations on forecast skill. In particular, the future state of the atmosphere is extremely sensitive to initial conditions yet there are insufficient observations to fully initialize an NWP model. Techniques for initializing NWP models - called data assimilation - were and continue to be a key source of model error. As a result, we cover these methods in detail. Beyond initial condition uncertainty, there are fundamental limits on the predictive skill of NWP models. These limits, a consequence of the fundamentally non-linear dynamics of the atmosphere, were first described by Edward Lorenz and usually referred to as ""chaos theory."" For operational weather forecasting, the implication is that single, deterministic models are necessarily limited in skill, even with near-perfect initial conditions. As a result, operational forecast centers have moved towards ensemble-based forecasting. The development and use of ensemble models are discussed in detail in this class. Next, the model must be moved forward in time. Basic numerical methods used to advance the model in time, typically using finite difference techniques, are described and the recent shift to finite volume methods are introduced and discussed in the context of the latest NWP models. We then describe parameterization schemes that NWP models use to account for phenomena not directly resolved by the model. We discuss several important schemes relevant to precipitation, including convective parameterizations and microphysics, and the planetary boundary layer. The course concludes with a review of one of the latest operational NWP models."

The course will provide students with knowledge and experience to increase the likelihood of success whether as a principal in a small company or an investor representative."
MGMT 427W: Managing an Entrepreneurial Start-up,"Start-up companies have a high failure rate. Acquiring and balancing limited resources, changing direction quickly, building a coherent team, developing an organization's culture from scratch, managing intellectual property, and creating new markets all test a wide range of managerial skills not usually demanded in one person within a larger organization. Whereas a large company has a strong and well-defined structure and ample resources to deal with unexpected challenges, a start-up usually has insufficient resources and/or management experience, yet it must deal on a daily basis with important and often unpredictable forces. Students will be exposed to these tensions and experience through problem-based learning methods that illustrate what it is like to start and grow a new company. The course will provide students with the knowledge and experience to increase their likelihood of success whether as a principal in a small company or an investor representative. Managing a Startup is a problem-based learning (PBL) course, where the learning is student-centered, with faculty acting primarily in the role of facilitators. Active learning happens in this course because students are engaged in the analysis of the complex situations that underlie startup companies. The course leverages the on-line course management system to define weekly learning objectives, support electronic delivery of assignments and provide robust video content from entrepreneurs, investors and key employees, who provide additional insights into the management decisions and ethical dilemmas the leader of a startup faces.

MGMT 486: Entrepreneurial Investment and Resource Acquisition,"As resource integrator's, entrepreneurs must first understand what resources are needed to create a new venture (through Entrepreneurial Opportunity Creation) and then solicit and organize internal and external resources (aka Venture Capital). Although venture capital is often conceptualized as formal investments made by large investment institutions seeking high growth opportunities, a more inclusive definition of venture capital more aptly considers all forms of external resource sharing to provide the creation of value, new ventures and wealth. The entrepreneurial ecosystem offers an expanding number of tools to aid new venture creation. As such, successful entrepreneurs need to be aware of the options and understand their respective strengths and weaknesses. Today's entrepreneurs can utilize traditional investment tools such as banking, personal debt obligations and venture capital institutions as well as emerging forms of investment tools such as crowdfunding resources, angel investors and accelerators. This course will provide students with the insights into raising venture capital, more broadly defined as any necessary external assets, through business planning, networking, investment pitching and negotiating. This will require students to compile the learning outcomes gained through prerequisite material in opportunity creation into a comprehensive business plan including financial projections. Through these activities, students in this course will be prepared to engage with applicable external resources providers and/or investors."

As such, the course relies on two overarching frameworks. The first is a model of organizational alignment; the second is a model for managing the change process. The course will emphasize application and practice, primarily by the use of cases. Students will be asked, class after class, to take the position of a senior manager or an adviser to a manager, and develop answers to questions like these: What's the real problem here? How are the elements of the problem interconnected? What should be done? How, specifically, should we go about it? Strategy Implementation and Organizational Change will be relevant for a broad array of students, including those hoping to be managers, consultants, investors, and entrepreneurs. Because the course focuses on changing entire organizations (rather than small parts of organizations), we will be primarily taking the point of view of senior managers. However, our frameworks and tools, and the skills students will develop, will be useful early in their careers, as they face the need to manage change in their own subunits, as well as the need to comprehend and contribute to firm-wide changes."

MICRB 107: Elementary Microbiology Laboratory,"is an introductory laboratory course designed for students who do not intend to pursue further study in the field. The course demonstrates the use and practice importance of microbes in everyday life. Instruction begins with the proper handling and visualization of microorganisms. Almost by definition, the vast majority of microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, students must learn the correct use of the light microscope. Instruction in the proper care and maintenance of the microscope is provided. Students prepare and stain specimens using a number of methods designed to characterize microorganisms. The importance of working safely in a laboratory setting is emphasized throughout the course. Many skills are developed in this laboratory course. Aseptic technique skills allow for the transfer organisms properly from one culture medium to another. A variety of media are used and the reasons for their use are explained. Students also learn how to quantify the number of bacteria in specimens such as water, soil or food. The course demonstrates ways to control microbial growth by various means for example, temperature, osmotic pressure, pH, exposure to ultraviolet light and use of disinfectants. Students learn the importance of controlling microbial growth on their person and how failure to do so can lead to the spread of disease, especially in hospital settings. Other experiments illustrate methods used to preserve food products and test water for contamination and may include molecular techniques to study microbial genomes. While students learn to isolate and identify organisms from their own body, other common bacteria found in or on the human body are also studied. A variety of diagnostic cultural and physiological tests are employed to identify organisms students have isolated. This simulates in a very real way the process physicians depend on for diagnosis of infectious diseases. A related experiment demonstrates how antibiotics that are likely to be effective in treating an infection are selected. Taken together, most of the experiments conducted in  are designed to encourage students to investigate the many important roles microorganisms play in the living world. The specific examples covered each semester may vary based on student and instructor interest.

It concerns especially what it means to define one¿s own life in light of social pressures, interpersonal conflict, and economic forces, with or without the aid of traditional or religious guidance. This that means the course focuses on metaphysical, moral, and social issues concerning reality, the nature of the self, the basis of values, and the relations between individuality and community, and studies philosophical treatises, imaginative literature, and other genres of writing. Representative authors include Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Marcel, Wright, Ellison, Jaspers, Fanon, Camus, Beauvoir, Sartre, and Lorraine Hansberry."
PHIL 103W: Ethics,"Through reading and discussion of classical and contemporary sources, this WAC course provides an introduction to the basic questions of ethics, the major currents in traditional ethical theory (virtue ethics, deontology, consequentialism), and more recent developments (e.g., care ethics). These schools of thought offer distinct answers about how we should decide what to do and about what makes a character, a decision, an action good or bad, right or wrong. Students will gain a basic understanding of concepts such as agency, autonomy, and moral responsibility, while also reflecting on the foundations, scope, and limits of moral reasoning: Are ethical norms universal, particular, or culturally relative? How is the moral life of the individual related to political life? Are there moral solutions to social problems or vice versa?"
PHIL 105: Philosophy of Law,"This course surveys philosophical questions concerning any legal system. What counts as a law? Do judges interpret or create new law? How can laws be unfair? What kinds of punishment, if any, are appropriate? When is civil disobedience justified? Could there be international law, and how can rights be enforced? These questions will often be asked in the context of the American system of common law and statutes, and thus will overlap with questions of federalism, constitutionalism, democracy, the police and prison systems, and social and economic structures. They will also require investigating the views of human nature underlying various philosophical positions. In general, the course examines the relations between human values, ethics, and law and the way these relations affect the organization of broader social, political, and religious institutions."
PHIL 108H: Honors Social and Political Philosophy,"This course studies philosophical views about large-scale human relations: in groups, communities, populations, nations, and countries. By studying prominent philosophers and positions it investigates the following kinds of questions: Why might anarchy give way to government? How do political arrangements differ from domestic, friendship, or business obligations? Ought people organize to pursue a common good or goal? What does fundamental opposition about religion, morality, financial interest, and human sentiment mean for integration into a public realm? Is the personal always political, and what deserves to be kept private? Such questions have animated philosophy since its origins, is of vibrant contemporary interest, requires development of a view of human nature, and relates to ethics, psychology, sociology, law and criminology, economics, and political science. By the course's end, students should have a greater critical understanding of the nature of social and political organization, influences on human values, and the traditional philosophical problem concerning the good society."

PHIL 109: Aesthetics,"Aesthetics is the philosophical study of our experience of certain natural and artistic objects that incite pleasure or displeasure in us, and which we judge to be beautiful, ugly, or sublime. Aesthetics asks: What makes something beautiful? Are our judgments of beauty universal? What counts as art? What are the relations between beauty, morality, and truth? The objective of this course will be to provide students with a survey of historical and contemporary perspectives on these questions. The students should leave the course with a good grounding in aesthetic theory as well as an understanding of how the theoretical considerations apply in art criticism."
PHIL 10: Critical Thinking,"This course provides a critical awareness of the function, nature, strengths, and weaknesses of argumentation in its various real-world and academic forms and contexts. Students examine the construction of persuasive arguments, discover types of fallacy, and learn how to evaluate reasoning for validity and soundness (that is, logicality and truth)."
PHIL 139: Latino/a Philosophy,"This introduction to Latino/a Philosophy covers the historical experience of Latino/a peoples and the impact that those experiences have had and can have on ""American"" philosophy. It also covers race, class, gender, and ethnicity in relation to the Latino/a experience, and thus ethics, political theory, legal theory, critical philosophy of race, and feminist philosophy. In the process it offers an introduction to key themes in contemporary philosophy. The course includes comparisons with African American, Asian, and Native American philosophies."
PHIL 14: Love and Sex,"This course examines the dominant philosophical and theological theories of love and sexuality in the Western world; historical and recent critiques of those theories; and the relevance of gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation to all such thinking about love and sex. Related ethical issues include monogamy, same-sex marriage, cultural differences, pornography, and consent, especially in contemporary US context."
PHIL 15: How to Live,"Philosophy, uniquely, studies how best to live. But being better at questions than at answers, philosophy mainly provides hypotheses about the nature of good life and the various routes to it. Does it mean minimizing mental suffering, through elimination of superstition and fear? Or control of one's bodily desires, through feats of endurance? Or modesty about what you know, through examination of one's beliefs? Or reducing the amount of injustice you do, by thinking about the consequences of every action? Or changing the way people think, by revealing the power dynamics beneath everyday social institutions? Each week this course articulates one hypothesis from Western (e.g., Greek, Roman, European, American) or non-Western (e.g., Indian, Chinese) philosophy, historical or contemporary, then makes sense of the reasons for it, and then puts it into personal (or group) practice for five days. Students track, process, and evaluate their experiences through journaling, blogging, and other modes of writing, some of which will involve discussion with other students. Each week also features philosophical, literary, spiritual, or journalistic readings expressing the tenets of the particular way of life, defending it against other ways of life, or exploring the particular historical/cultural context that occasioned it. These readings may include, for example, Socratic dialogues, Stoic handbooks, meditation mantras, existential dramas, political manifestos, nature journals, or book reviews. At the semester's end, students invent their own philosophical ""best way of life,"" formulating and justifying rules, models, or virtues to live by, and engage in conversation with other students on this topic. Students should leave the class recognizing the diversity and challenge of a range of way-of-life ideals, their historical context and contemporary promise, how to decide on their appropriateness for themselves, and what it would mean to adopt, refine, and support their own ""philosophy"" of life."
PHIL 1: The Big Questions,"This course plunges students into the deepest philosophical questions: Why is there something rather than nothing? Can I be sure about anything? What is the purpose of life? Is morality real or conventional? Can the existence of God be proven or disproven? Can science explain everything? Students will meet a range of historical and contemporary formulations of philosophical questions such as these, study various types of response, and acquire the analytical and expository skills to develop and defend their own perspectives. The course proceeds through discussion, reading, writing, and other assignments"
PHIL 297: Special Topics,"Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."
PHIL 3: Ethical Life,"This course offers students an overview of ethical issues, moral reasoning, and questions concerning the good and flourishing life for individuals and groups.

Students will study and evaluate competing accounts of the right way to live, including their overall plausibility, their background assumptions, and their practical implementation."
PHIL 406: Seminar in Business Ethics,"This course examines ethical issues introduced and engaged by business. These may include the relation between morality and contemporary business practices, the nature of money, corporate social responsibility, self-regulation and government, advertising, social consequences of systems of production, environmental economics, economic inequality and justice, the relationship between business and politics, the philosophical foundations and justifications for business and economic systems, and central positions and figures in the history of these questions."
PHIL 409: Seminar in Aesthetics,"Aesthetics examines questions related to the nature of art and beauty as well as the nature of aesthetic judgment and experience. Building on its precursor (), this course explores selected topics in traditional or contemporary aesthetics in greater depth. Typical issues include the distinction between beauty, sublimity, and ugliness; the nature of aesthetic experience and artistic value and their relation to knowledge; the basis and validity of aesthetic judgments; the relationship between art, morality, and society; and the influence of social identities (race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, etc.) on the production and reception of art. In addition to familiarizing themselves with theoretical approaches, students will typically also engage in the discussion and critical interpretation of specific artworks (e.g. paintings, sculptures, photographs, films, musical compositions or performances, literary works), both as a way of exemplifying particular aesthetic issues and approaches, and with a view to enhancing students¿ aesthetic perception and experience."
PHIL 410: Seminar in Philosophy of Science,"This course reviews the development of philosophy of science in the past century and studies its development once it turns its attention to modern cosmology and biology in this century. We begin with the Vienna School, which took physics to be the most important science, and analyzed deductive thought by means of predicate logic. Then we will look at the work of Thomas Kuhn, who insists on the importance of the history of science for philosophy: we must look at how the sciences develop over time. This makes biology especially interesting: we begin with Darwin, and trace developments to the discovery of DNA and the importance of genetics, and consider the way biology combines the microscopic, the macroscopic, and the study of biological systems. This leads science to interact with politics, as the issue of global warming becomes apparent. How does theory intersect with practical deliberation? The development of modern cosmology also reminds us that the whole universe has a history, and changes our sense of our environment. So it seems that the philosophy of science must include not just deductive thought, but also historical thought and practical deliberation."
PHIL 413: Seminar in Philosophy of Literature,"This course builds on its precursor () to provide a deeper, more focused perspective on specific topics and issues, for example the nature of fiction and its relation to fact, the value of literary works of art (aesthetic, cognitive, educational, and social), and the nature and proper norms of literary interpretation, translation, analysis, and historiography. Assigned readings will typically be philosophical or (more broadly) theoretical in character, though the instructor may incorporate works of literature into the syllabus. In addition to skills in both the writing and the critical analysis of texts, students will deepen their appreciation of the value of literary representation and its relation to the distinct but closely related field of philosophical reflection."
PHIL 425W: Epistemology,"The nature of cognition and perception, the conditions of experience, and the justification and truth of belief."
PHIL 426W: Seminar in Metaphysics,"Examines the nature of reality, the existence of freedom, and the nature of matter, mind, and values."
PHIL 435: Science and Religon,"This course offers an intensive examination of the complex relationship between religion, science, and philosophy in different traditions and historical periods. How did science and religion emerge as distinct ways of understanding the universe? Were the two always in conflict? What is the nature of this conflict - is it historical, cultural, conceptual, linguistic, or methodological? Are there ways to make them compatible? Do they constitute separate realms with clear-cut borders and jurisdictions? In pursuit of wellinformed answers to these questions, the specific topics of this course will typically include modern scientific conceptions of the natural world and human life (e.g., cosmology, the origin and value of life, evolution) and the contemporary impact of these conceptions on religious belief; ethical questions stemming from scientific methods and biotechnology (e.g., cloning and genetic engineering and the religious responses to such acts of ""playing God""), and examples of contemporary scientific approaches to explaining religious experience (e.g., cognitive science, neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology). The instructor may use discretion in selecting representative texts by religious studies scholars, philosophers, scientists, and historians of science with a view to offering a diverse set of authoritative and sometimes controversial approaches to the subject."
PHIL 437: World Philosophies,"Philosophical traditions, problems, and authors in African, Asian, Middle- Eastern, Native American, or other non-Western cultures and intellectual traditions."
PHIL 439: Asian Philosophies and Issues,"Exploration of the traditions, problems, and authors of one or more of the philosophical systems of Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism."
PHIL 458: Seminar in Contemporary Philosophy,"This course will explore some of the influential theories and texts in contemporary philosophy. Contemporary philosophy encompasses a broad range of inquiry, from attention to the treatment of knowledge, reason, and the subject; to ethical and political issues; and to aesthetics and metaphysical problems. Themes may include such questions as: What is the status of the human subject in relation to the world? What is the status of truth once we recognize the radical contingency of our historically-bound existence? What is the relation between aesthetic value and ethical value? What does it mean to exist as a temporal agent? What forms does the exercise of power assume in late-modern societies and what resources does philosophy provide for a critique of societies of control? What resources are there in recent developments in philosophy for revitalizing the ancient ideal of philosophy as a way of life, including the concern with the flourishing life? Through reading and discussion, this course will introduce students to some of the central approaches to contemporary philosophy, some of the most pressing issues, as well as the central controversies of contemporary philosophy. Students will develop their interpretative and philosophical skills, while gaining a deeper understanding of central themes and figures in philosophy over the past century."
PHIL 490: Dewey,"Critically examines the metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic, aesthetics, education theory, and social and political philosophy of this major American pragmatist."

PHIL 5: Film and Philosophy,"This course examines film as both an aesthetic medium and as a medium for the exploration of philosophical questions. In addition to watching films, class assignments will include the reading of interpretative texts about specific films, philosophical discussions of film as a form of art-work, and writings by major film makers and film critics. With its origins in the late 19th-century, film is an quintessentially modern form of art that reflects changes in modern society (consumer culture, political organization, and cultural modes of perception), advances in technologies (cameras, sound recording, computer graphics), and aesthetic forms of expression. This complex intersection of society, technology and art will be a focal point in understanding what is both novel and traditional about films: how do films change our perception of the world? How can films shape our collective consciousness? How are traditional structures of narrative transformed through the unique combination of visual and auditory experience in films? These and other questions are central to an understanding of film as a modern form of art. From the beginning of film-making, films have often been used by directors and screen-writers as a medium for the exploration of the human condition, social consciousness, and historical awareness. The genres of historical fiction and science fiction have traditionally represented two important forms in which film raises and seeks to answer philosophical questions. Film is also a medium for the exploration of the social structures and values: family relations, love, friendship, and other social forms of existence are often the main theme of scrutiny and experimentation in films. How can we read what a film reveals about such social relations and individual psychologies? How can film explore basic questions of human existence? Can such philosophically minded films also aspire to art-works of poetical beauty? This richness in how films can provoke us to reflect upon the past, the present, and the future will be critically explored through different ways in which philosophers and film critics have reflected on film. These readings will be paired with specific films, with films and assigned readings drawn from international films, classical films from the 20th-century, and contemporary science fiction films."

"PLSC 112N: Ethics in Citizenship, Politics, and Government","This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. It is often said that politics is a dirty business, meaning that unethical behavior is prevalent in politics. But this is often said with a twinge of disappointment, sometimes with bitterness or anger. We wish that it were not so. One part of an effort to improve the ethical character of politics is to strive for a clear understanding of what ethical political action is. This course endeavors to arrive at that understanding by considering some of the most profound and influential ways of understanding ethical action. One example is that which is derived from Aristotle and supplemented by Martha Nussbaum. Another example is that which is derived from the writings of Immanuel Kant. We will use perspectives written at this level of generality in the analysis of detailed case studies of ethical choices made by citizens, government employees, and elected officials."
PLSC 14H: International Relations Honors,"What causes war and what makes it stop? When is international aid or military intervention effective? Why are some states wealthy and others plagued by poverty and underdevelopment? How does international trade affect developing countries? What can and should states do to protect human rights around the world? This course provides students with the background and conceptual tools to answer these and similar questions. It teaches students to think systematically about the complex relationships that constitute world politics and to critically engage prevailing academic and policy arguments about global affairs. Students are introduced to the international political system as the arena in which states develop foreign policies of cooperation and competition with other states to pursue power, enhance security and develop economically. They explore how various non-state actors (NGOs, social movements, corporations) and international governmental organizations (UN, IMF, World Bank, WHO) influence interactions among states and between states and their citizens in matters such as interstate and civil wars, terrorism, ethnic conflict, human rights, inequality, global trade, resource scarcity and climate change. The course supports honors students in their progress toward independent research by focusing on what political scientists studying International Relations do, the types of questions they ask, and the methods they employ to answer those questions, including game theory, statistical analysis and historical and contemporary case studies. Engagement with scholarly literature prepares student to draw on existing research to frame their own research questions about international relations."
PLSC 17N: Introduction to Political Theory,"This course focuses on the concepts, principles and values used to explain, justify and challenge the organization and use of collective power. It introduces the field of political theory as an intellectual tradition that combines reflection on what political life is and what it should accomplish with investigation of the values manifest through existing political institutions and how those institutions can be best organized to achieve desired outcomes. Through analysis of selected works of major thinkers, beginning with the Ancient Greeks and extending through the contemporary period, students consider questions and problems that philosophers, political leaders and citizens have grappled with for millennia: What is a political community? What is justice? Who is included in the realm of justice? What is the best form of government? What do I owe to the state? What does the state owe to me? What is the proper purpose and scope of government? Students learn to critically engage arguments in canonical texts to understand both how they contributed to debates in their own time and how subsequent theorists and activists have interpreted them to articulate and challenge various forms of exclusion and oppression. Ultimately, students are invited to see political theory as a conversation across time to clarify concepts that are fundamental to the study and practice of politics yet remain contested, such as freedom, equality, democracy and justice, and to distinguish between the legitimate purposes of government and the arbitrary use of power. Through the course students will learn to employ and evaluate political concepts with care and precision so they can participate in that conversation productively as democratic citizens as well as in further study of political theory. Students may not get credit for both  and"

"PLSC 1H: American Politics: Principles, Processes and Powers","This course examines the American democracy by looking at the dynamic interaction between the founding ideals of the United States government, the institutions established by the Constitution, and the ongoing contest for power within and through those institutions. Students will learn how Congress, the Presidency and the Supreme Court shape law and public policy; how the electoral process influences the decisions of voters and political parties; and how the media, interest groups, political action committees, and public opinion impact political outcomes. Through these topics the course takes up questions such as, Who has a voice in American politics and why are some political actors more influential than others? Do the electoral and policy making processes uphold democratic values? How responsive is the United States government to public wants? How does the media influence citizens¿ political preferences and behavior? The course both provides a foundation for further study of politics and equips students with the capacity to act politically on their own behalf and in concert with their communities. Students are empowered to interpret and pursue their interests, rights, and opportunities within the US political system in relation to the values of democratic equality and liberty the system was organized to secure, and to influence the process through which policies that shape their lives in critical ways are made. The course supports honors students in their progress toward independent research by focusing on what political scientists studying American politics do, the types of questions they ask, and the methods they employ to answer those questions. Engagement with scholarly literature prepares students to draw on existing research to frame their own research questions about American politics."
PLSC 210N: Rights in America,"This course is an introduction to the emergence and enforcement of rights in the United States. The course provides an overview of how rights have been codified into law and interpreted by the courts. The primary focus is how and why the conception of rights has changed over time. Emphasis is placed on the rights of groups that were denied equal citizenship when the Constitution was ratified. We will examine how these marginalized groups have engaged in a continual struggle for basic rights since the American founding. The course begins with an overview of different types of rights and the role of the legal system in articulating and enforcing them. Students are introduced to debates about the sources of rights, including the implications of conceptions of rights as grounded in natural law and as arising from positive law. They look specifically at the role of rights in the founding documents of United States and how civil rights are interpreted through pivotal Supreme Court cases as ascribing - or denying - particular powers and responsibilities to individuals and groups. The second section of the course focuses on the rights of African Americans and women. It progresses chronologically from slavery to the modern civil rights movement, from coverture to women's rights. Particular attention is given to the NAACP's campaign against racial discrimination in housing, education, and in the criminal justice system. The final part of the course emphasizes campaigns for rights recognition in modern times, including LGBTQ rights and disability rights. The course concludes with a discussion of how context impacts rights, including students' rights and rights during wartime, and examination of the potential and limitations of rights as a basis for political protection. Throughout the course students are introduced to the interdependent political, legal and philosophical dimension of rights and how rights in the United States have come to be recognized and enforced through political action, legal codification, and judicial interpretation."
PLSC 267N: Government and Politics of the Middle East,"This course provides an introductory overview of the politics of the Middle East. It introduces students to the political development of Middle Eastern countries and the construction of the Middle Eastern state system through a historical examination of the period of Islamic Empires through Colonialism and Independence. It discusses the major political ideological factors that have influenced political development in the Middle East. It examines the political economy of Middle Eastern states as well as the political economy of development of the region. The course studies the politics of gender, ethnicity and other identities in the region. It also covers major political conflicts within the Middle East and between Middle Eastern countries and the outside world."
PLSC 296: Independent Studies,"Creative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses."
PLSC 306: Senior Thesis Writing Workshop,"This seminar supports the writing and editing of senior honors theses.  PL SC 306H Senior Thesis Writing Workshop (1-3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This is a workshop for honors students in their senior year writing their thesis in political science. There are no assigned readings or written assignments outside of those necessary for the completion of your thesis. Participants are expected to make progress on their own thesis and to contribute to the collaborative enterprise of discussing thesis progress and problems while critiquing one another's work. Each participant is expected to make progress on their thesis, to collectively discuss and consider the research process during workshop sessions, and come prepared to offer useful feedback and criticism on other participants' research."
PLSC 309H: Quantitative Political Analysis,"This course introduces students to research design and quantitative analysis techniques used in political science with an aim toward developing transferrable skills for future coursework in the political science major, especially the senior thesis process. Students will learn how to construct theories and design studies, how to quantify concepts, and how to test theories using a variety of statistical techniques, including descriptive analysis, correlation, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. The course will include classroom lectures and computer lab time to enable students to work hands-on with datasets. This course is the first in a three-course sequence for students interested in writing an honors thesis in political science."
PLSC 405H: The American Presidency,"An examination of the selection methods for, and powers of, the American presidency, as well as other chief executives."
PLSC 414: Dictators and Their Demise,"Dictators and Their Demise examines the political economy of authoritarian rule.  PL SC 414 Dictators and Their Demise (3) Dictators and Their Demise provides a broad exploration about how non-democratic governments throughout the world rule. We examine: the conditions that give rise to authoritarianism; the variety of authoritarian regimes; the strategies authoritarian leaders use to stay in power; the consequences of different types of authoritarianism for outcomes such as economic growth and human development; and the domestic and international sources of authoritarian demise. The course covers cases of authoritarian rule in: Chile, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and the former Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo or DRC). The course builds knowledge about the governments under which most people in the Global South lived during the 20th century. Even today, roughly half of the world's population lives under some form of non-democratic government. Yet almost all courses currently in the curriculum, particularly in the field of comparative politics, focus exclusively on democratic forms of government. This course therefore examines a new topic not currently offered in the curriculum. In additional to learning about different types of authoritarian rule, students form an understanding of how common foreign policy tools, such as economic sanctions, foreign aid, and human rights shaming, are likely to affect domestic politics in these countries. This knowledge helps students critically evaluate foreign policy relationships between democracies, such and the United States, and dictatorships. Course materials cover theoretical approaches to the study of authoritarian rule, in-depth case studies (including novels, biographies, and documentary), and empirical research. This course requires student presentations, weekly reading assignments, descriptive analysis of quantitative data in graphs, multiple written assignments, and a final take-home essay exam. Students develop analytic skills through the weekly written homework assignments in which they apply the broad theoretical concepts to analyze counter factual situations from specific cases of authoritarian rule. Oral presentations develop inter-personal skills and require students to research specific cases of authoritarian rule currently in the news. This helps students critically evaluate current events. Finally, the written assignments require students to develop skills working with real data. Students collect and graphically present basic descriptive data about economic and human development in non-democratic countries: economic data, infant mortality, literacy, and indicators of women's well-being. Using real world data to make international comparisons helps students develop skills to form and articulate complex arguments, and teaches them the basics of research design."
PLSC 424: Topics in Comparative Government and Institutions,Topics in the comparative analysis of representative contemporary Western and non-Western governmental institutions.
PLSC 430: Selected Works in the History of Political Theory,"Detailed examination and analysis of a selected major work, thinker, or tradition in the history of political theory."
"PLSC 431: Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Political Theories","Political theories of Plato and Aristotle; selected Greek, Roman, medieval, and Renaissance theorists through Machiavelli."
PLSC 433: Political Foundations of the Early American Republic,"The course introduces students to the major political and philosophical movements that influenced the founders of the early American republic.  PL SC 433 Political Foundations of the Early American Republic (3)The course introduces students to the major political and philosophical movements that influenced the founders of the early American republic. The first section of the course, set in the ancient world, will examine the earliest experiments in democratic government in both Greece and the Roman Republic. In addition to studying the structure and traditions of ancient governments, students will consider competing theories for why these early democratic experiments ultimately failed. The second section of the course traces the gradual evolution of representative democracy in Britain from the signing of Magna Carta to the quiet subjugation of the monarchy in the 19th Century. Recognizing that the theoretical structures of political power remain somewhat fixed in this period, students will consider how legal precedent can gradually transform seemingly static political institutions. The third section of the course examines American efforts to establish stable representative institutions in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War. Looking back at both ancient and modern constitutional traditions, students will examine how prior democratic experiments heavily influenced the deliberations of the founders both at the Constitutional Convention and in the establishment of the new federal republic."
PLSC 434: War and Development in Africa,"This course will examine the relationship between war and development in sub-Saharan Africa in the post colonial era.  /  War and Development in Africa (3) (IL) This course will examine the relationship between development and war in sub-Saharan Africa in the modern era. Specifically, it will analyze the extent to which the processes of state building, nation building, and international intervention have contributed to the incidence of both civil war and international conflict in Africa. We will begin with a review of several theoretical arguments on the causes of warfare in Africa and then turn to a discussion of theses on African political development. This course complements present offerings in international relations and comparative politics in the PLSC department and can serve as an advanced undergraduate offering in the African Studies concentration in AFR. The course directly complements our present offerings in international conflict given that we don';t have a regularly offered course that focuses on conflict in a specific region. In addition, it will augment our comparative politics offerings with an examination of prominent issues in comparative politics such as political development, democracy, and modernization. The course will fulfill the IL requirement and encourage students understanding of the historical background as well as the political, economic, and cultural factors that influence African politics. African conflicts are often viewed as ""ethnic conflicts"" and in this class students have an opportunity to assess the extent to which ethnic, linguistic, or religious factors influence the likelihood of conflict and contribute to development in African states. Students will also be required to write essays evaluating the contribution of a range of theoretical arguments on Africa';s conflicts in order to assess the degree to which cultural more than political or economic factors contribute to their onset. Students will then have the opportunity to conduct more extensive research on a specific African case to develop their analyses further. These exercises will often require that students reevaluate their beliefs about social identities such as race (e.g. in Rwanda the difference between Tutsi and Hutu is often viewed as a ""racial"" difference between black Africans, which is at odds with most Western conceptions of race). They also require students to challenge stereotypes regarding the subordination of African values in conflicts to a simple concern with ""tribe"". Students will gain a broader knowledge and appreciation of the different values, traditions, and cultures evident in Africa and understand how these can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict. Evaluation in the course will consist largely of examination of the students' brief expository essays and larger case studies for which students will be encouraged to conduct original research. The course should be offered biannually with a class limit of about 40 students."
PLSC 436: Civil Wars,"This course examines factors influencing the onset, duration, severity, termination, recurrence, and consequences of civil wars around the world.  PL SC 436 Civil Wars (3) This course provides a broad exploration of the causes, characteristics, and consequences of civil wars. In particular, it investigates what makes civil wars more likely to occur, what influences how long they last, how severe they are, and how likely they are to recur, while also considering their consequences for the states that experience them. It considers the scholarly research on this topic over the past decade or more, and builds an awareness both for what are the known regularities as well as what are the continuing uncertainties about the place of civil war in the contemporary international system. It does this specifically within the context of scientific research about civil wars, and thus also advances student knowledge about how social scientists learn what they know about how the world works. Building on this perspective, and after absorbing the lessons to be learned from the literature, students will gain even greater appreciation for the quality of knowledge about civil wars by conducting their own detailed analysis of a civil war (each student will study one civil war of their choosing) asking how well the civil war they study fits patterns identified by the literature. This course complements, without duplicating, existing political science courses about militarized political conflict, and qualifies as one course majors can take to satisfy their 400-level course hours requirement. In addition to political science majors, it should be of interest to international politics majors, students in other social science majors, and perhaps Masters students in the School of International Affairs as well."
PLSC 437: War in World Politics,"Causes, resolution, and consequences of crises and wars; testing theories of conflict using both case and statistical studies."

PLSC 445Y: Politics of Affirmative Action,"Examines history, politics, and economics of the use of special programs to advance racial interests in the U.S.  /  /  Politics of Affirmative Action (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The objectives of this course are to introduce students to the relationship between affirmative action and other policies purportedly designed to end racial inequality in the U.S. This course approaches the study of affirmative action in the context of the historic racial discrimination and inequality that Black Americans have faced since the founding of the Nation. The purpose of this course is to help students think about how contemporary and historic affirmative action policies relate to race, concepts racial inequality, the historic and continuing causes for racial inequality, public opinion, American politics and economic thought. The course materials will lead students through scholarly and popular articles, books and video presentations on the topic. It is hoped that students will become familiar with the history of affirmative action from its conception. Students will gain an intimate understanding of affirmative action economic and social outcomes on various racial groups. No prior knowledge is assumed, however a knowledge of civil rights history, quantitative methods, and constitutional law will be useful. The Politics of Affirmative Action satisfies the requirements for major and minor electives for the African American Studies, and major and minor electives for Political Science, and Labor Studies and Industrial Relations. Students are evaluated on the basis of an examination, term paper, class participation and class presentations of papers."
PLSC 446: Business and Government Relations,"An examination of the interaction between business and government across different types of political systems.  PL SC 446 Business and Government Relations (3) This course examines the interaction between business and government across different types of political systems. Intellectual approaches from various disciplines will be used to understand different dimensions of business and government interactions. Models of interaction to be covered in the course include pluralism, corporatism, business as capital, business as firm models, sectoral models, network models, and clientalism. Particular attention will be given to the interactions of business and government during the policy process, from formation to implementation. Case studies from developed and developing countries, and examples of specific policy proposals will be utilized to help students analyze business interactions with government, and political interactions with business. Specifically, students will analyze variation in the structure of business-government relations across countries' different political systems, economic systems, and development levels. Through this course, students will be able to construct an appropriate framework to evaluate the business and political implications of adopting different business-government models, and construct analytical frameworks to understand the policy implications of adopting different models for the same policy."
PLSC 458: Government and Politics of East Asia,"This course examines the political systems, institutions, and leadership of East Asian countries. This course examines the political systems, institutions, and leadership of East Asian countries. Students will learn about the nature and extent of political change that has occurred across East Asia, with particular attention to the history of the region, and the regime changes that have occurred in East Asian countries. Students also will compare the political development and experiences of different countries in the region, and consider how their development and experiences compare to countries beyond East Asia. Upon completion of the course, students will have knowledge of the government and politics of East Asian regimes, and the region's role in global politics."
PLSC 466: Political Psychology,"An interdisciplinary investigation of the major topics and debates characterizing the subfield of political psychology.  PL SC 466 Political Psychology (3) This course offers an interdisciplinary investigation of the major topics and debates characterizing the subfield of political psychology. It draws on research being done in a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields including social, developmental and clinical psychology; the cognitive neurosciences; biological anthropology; genetics; evolution; and behavioral economics to examine political behavior. Specifically, the course will examine the thinking and actions of both political elites and the mass public, and consider the reasoning processes they employ in order to make sense of the political world. Topics to be covered include how emotions (e.g., fear, lust) shape human reasoning; how preferences develop; how differences in cognition, emotion and personality inform political judgment and shape political leadership; how prejudices develop and affect war and other conflicts; how political and social identities develop and how they affect individuals' political judgments and decisions; how neurobiological influences operate in conjunction with social and cultural factors to affect how individuals process information; and how genetics and hormones affect individuals political development and behavior. Through these and other topics covered in the course, students will develop an understanding of how political elites and ordinary citizens process information, develop preferences and make decisions, and why, as a consequence, they act as they do. This course fulfills the distribution requirement for American politics and comparative politics, as well as the advanced and related course requirements for Political Science majors. The course also fulfills the supporting course requirement for International Politics majors."

PLSC 503: Multivariate Analysis for Political Research,"Analysis of selected issues in quantitative political analysis; introduction to advanced multivariate analysis techniques.  PL SC 503 Multivariate Analysis for Political Research (3) This course is part of the methods sequence required of doctoral students in political science. The prerequisites are PL SC 501 and PL SC 502. The course has three objectives. First, students will acquire a theoretical/mathematical understanding of multivariate regression analysis. Such understanding is fundamental to applying appropriate applications of quantitative methodology to substantive problems. Students must acquire clear and correct conceptual understanding of the statistical ideas behind the mathematics in order to succeed in this course. Second, students will learn to program in SAS to relate statistical ideas to practice and develop a set of programming skills that will benefit their research over the long run. They are expected to acquire proficiency in SAS in terms of data management and statistical analysis, which will be useful when they find the need to pick up some other statistical software package in the future. Third, students will gain experience in quantitative research by applying their statistical and computing skills to substantive problems in political science. Students should aim at producing publishable quality work. They would also develop the ability to evaluate other scholars' use of quantitative methods."
PLSC 504: Topics in Political Methodology,"This course examines a range of statistical models widely used in political science that generalize from linear normal regression.  PL SC 504 Topics in Political Methodology (3) This is an elective course in statistical methods designed to meet the particular needs of students in the political science Ph. D. curriculum. PL SC 504 is tailored to focus on the specific issues that arise in the types of data found in political science applications. Students are expected to have completed the three required foundational courses in political methodology or their equivalents. This course examines a range of regression-like models widely used in empirical political science. Its core focus is on maximum likelihood estimation of models for various kinds of limited-dependent and qualitative response variables. Specific models covered are widely used in political science today, including binary logit and probit, multinomial logit and probit, ordered logit and probit, and Poisson regression models. Additional topics include models for time-to-event (survival) data, panel data and time-series cross-sectional analysis, item response theory, multi-level models, and methods for causal inference using observational data. Students will apply these models in a series of homework assignments, a replication project, and a final exam. Empirical political scientists must have familiarity with these models; these techniques represent a minimal level of statistical competence necessary for those seeking to do advanced quantitative analysis in the political science. The material in this course is technical, but students will be given an intuitive rationale for each model. Weekly homework assignments will be based on data from published research in political science."
PLSC 544: Race and American Politics,"In this seminar, we will explore what race is, why it matters, and how it shapes attitudes, behaviors, policies, and institutions. While this is a political science course, the seminar draws ideas and insights from a broad array of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. It demonstrates that an explicit consideration of race is needed to fully comprehend American politics. Students emerge from the course with an understanding of the scholarly approaches and key substantive debates."
PLSC 553: Comparative Racial and Ethnic Politics,"Since its founding, the United States has had to balance the American creed of equality for all, on one hand, with racial inequality, on the other hand. Is this challenge something exclusive to the United States? This course will provide students the opportunity to analyze how race and ethnicity are constructed across the globe as well as how race and politics interact across state borders. Students will examine how race is constructed and racial ideologies are developed in several countries including the U.S., South Africa, France, Australia and Brazil. By the end of the semester, students should be able to fully engage and contribute to broad literatures on the politics and policy of race and racism. They should readily be able to answer questions such as: What role do countries and their institutions play in developing racial ideologies and racial hierarchies? What political purpose do ideologies such as ""racial democracy"" serve? How might social scientists best compare notions such as U.S.'s ""race problem,"" Latin America's ""shade problem"" and Europe's ""immigrant problem""? What are the perils of cross-border comparisons, and how, if possible, can social scientists account for state differences in their analyses? The major objectives of the course are to: (1) analyze the effects of historical, social, economic, cultural and global forces on the development of racial and ethnic politics in various countries; (2) define and critically analyze concepts relevant to the study of racial and ethnic politics; (3) identify, critique and apply major academic theories and debates regarding issues of race, ethnicity, inequality and reconciliation; (4) build analytical skills so that students will be able to effectively engage and communicate in public and scholarly discourse about race and ethnic politics; (5) improve writing skills, especially as they relate to manuscript and book reviews; (6) become cognizant of the difficulties that scholars must navigate as they approach topics related to the politics, race, ethnicity as well as comparative/cross-state analysis; and (7) develop a series of best practices to address methodological and theoretical challenges to studying race comparatively."
PLSC 565: International Conflict,"Research into the causes and consequences of international crises and wars, using various methodologies for theory assessment."
"PLSC 566: Conflict Management, Termination, and Bargaining","Research on termination and resolution of international conflicts, focusing on theory building and empirical assessment of theories of conflict resolution.  PL SC 566 Conflict Management, Termination, and Bargaining (3)This graduate seminar introduces and examines the dominant theories, hypotheses, and research concerning the termination and resolution of international and civil wars. Topics include international mediation, rational bargaining theory, conflict resolution vs. termination, third party intervention, peacekeeping, and peace duration. The focus is theoretical and research oriented; arguments about the causes of conflict resolution are assessed both logically and empirically, using both case study and statistical methods. The course examines whether and how theories of conflict management have been tested, and allows/encourages students to develop their own testable hypotheses about conflict management and termination. Existing research (primarily from political science, but also drawing on economics) is evaluated on its merits, and students then seek appropriate ways to extend that research."
PLSC 583: Modern Political and Social Theory,"Research on major developments and issues in modern political and social theory, such as critical theory, modernism, and postmodernism.  PL SC 583 Modern Political and Social Theory (3 per semester/maximum of 9) This course will survey recent versions of liberal theory as well as critical appraisals of that tradition. Particular attention will be paid to the developments of liberalism in the most recent work of Rawls and Habermas. We will then consider critical appraisals of liberalism arising from various corners: communitarianism, identity politics, and post-modernism. Throughout, we will explore themes concerning the grounds of political theorizing and normative justification, models of the self and the person presupposed in political theories, questions of individualism and collective identity, and the very possibility of stable meanings and generalized theory construction. Precise content will vary in subsequent offerings of the course, as determined by instructor. Students will consult with instructor prior to taking the course additional times. This course will be offered once a year with 12 seats per offering."

PLSC 60N: Society and Cultures in Modern Israel,"Israel is often portrayed in media and popular society in incomplete or distorted terms. In some cases, it is presented as a troubled, violent, dangerous place, as a place permeated by long-standing hatred between Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. In others, the focus is on the state's role as the center of Judsiam--a home of the ""chosen people"" and the source of inspiration for one of the world's great monotheistic religions. Some present it as a model for how a democracy can succeed under trying demographic, historic, and geopolitical circumstances. Others frame Israel as a place of conflagration (armageddon) that will usher in a messianic period or as a nation-state with a discriminatory regime that privileges its majority population over its minority and administers oppressive policies over Palestinians in the occupied territories it captured in the 1967 War. While there are elements of truth in each of these presentations, the full picture of Israeli society is much richer and more complex. This course teaches students to cut through the mythology, and develop a more accurate understanding of what Israel is in the 21st century. Since Israel is a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse society, it is only possible to understand the true nature of modern Israel through exploring the many sub-groups that comprise the Israeli citizenry. The course looks at Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews (both religious and secular), Muslim and Christian Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, Ethiopian-Israelis, Russian-Israelis, Bedouins, and Druze. For each group, it looks at demographics, background histories, migration patterns, institutions, cultural norms, values, and practices. We will look at what is important to each group, how they see and organize themselves, and how they understand and experience the world around them. The course aims to convey an understanding of the geographic, demographic, and social-historical context in which Israelis live as well as the diversity of Israeli culture. Students will be challenged to be critical readers of Israeli society and the way it is represented and to strive for measured, evidence-based analyses."

It is offered every Fall semester."
PNG 420: Applied Reservoir Analysis and Secondary Recovery,"P N G 420 Applied Reservoir Analysis and Secondary Recovery (3) This course addresses two major issues in petroleum engineering: water influx and water flooding. The displacement of oil or gas by water is a complicated physical process that has a great impact on recovery efficiencies. The first objective of the course is to merge the material balance method and transient flow solutions for the aquifer into one analysis tool for understanding and predicting water influx cases. Several analytical and numerical methods are presented including: linear and radial diffusion equation solutions, super position, Hurst simplified, Schilthuis and Hurst modified. The second objective of the course is to understand the fundamentals of displacement theory and practice. The extension of the Buckley and Leverett water flooding theory is presented for three-phase flow. Three-phase relative permeabilities are determined from experimental data. Several geometrical patterns are discussed in the course including: five spots, staggered line drive, direct line drive, four spots, seven spots, and nine spots. The efficiency of each pattern is determined. Strategies for selecting a pattern for special cases are presented. The behavior of each pattern with time, including oil recover, is an integral part of the course.The students use our computational facility throughout the course. They write material balance models and use large reservoir simulators for studying water influx cases."
PNG 440W: Formation Evaluation,"Formation Evaluation covers the characterization of oil and gas reservoir formations and methods for quantifying the volume of hydrocarbon resources therein. The course focuses on the petrophysical interpretation of wireline logs to meet these objectives, and also covers the operation and underlying physical principles of those tools. Topics covered include: the basic procedure of open hole logging, calculation of a geothermal gradient, understanding raster and digital well log files, quick look interpretation, reservoir volumetrics, understanding the physics of and cultivating the ability to interpret data from the traditional logging suite (gamma ray, spontaneous potential, resistivity devices, density, neutron, and sonic logs), coring, wireline formation testing, nuclear magnetic resonance logging, and interpretation in unconventional reservoirs. Best practices and limitations of the various well log tools are also discussed. Students are expected to perform complex engineering calculations using raw field data gathered from these tools, both from raster and digital well log files. As a ""writing across the curriculum"" course, students develop their technical writing skills through homework assignments that present their analyses in written reports."
PNG 450: Drilling Engineering,": Drilling Engineering covers the design and analysis of oil-field drilling operations and equipment. This course addresses a critical issue in petroleum and natural gas engineering: how to drill and complete oil and gas wells in a sound, economical, and environmentally safe manner. Drilling technology has advanced greatly since the first commercial oil well in the U.S. was drilled in northwest Pennsylvania in 1859. The true vertical depth of the well has grown from 69.5 feet from then to more than 15,000 ft, with the deepest at more than 40,000 feet, today. The horizontal length of a well has grown from theoretically zero to more than 10,000 feet, with the longest at 40,000 feet. The temperature and pressure of the formation that petroleum engineers need to drill through could easily reach 350 F and 20,000 psi or higher, and the formation and fracture gradient window becomes narrower, all making drilling and completion more challenging. In summary, it is becoming increasingly more challenging to drill wells. Thus, engineering design becomes more critical. The objectives of this course are to introduce the students to the science of drilling and completion. This includes learning the fundamentals of drilling fluids and drilling fluid design, and applying fluid mechanics and quantifying drilling hydraulics for complex fluid flow through drilling string and annular spaces. The course will also discuss the concepts and quantify the formation pressure and fracture pressure gradients for different methods of drilling. A key task for students will be to learn the methods for characterization, selection and optimization of casing design, and optimized bit design, and finally the course will discuss how to design directional and horizontal wells to optimize production and recovery from mature fields and unconventional resources, such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight oil in Pennsylvania. This course is a prerequisite for petroleum and natural gas engineering major courses. It is an elective course for majors such as chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, etc. The knowledge, methods, and practical skills in this course could also be used in various other industries including geothermal HVAC, ground water drilling, mineral exploration, and scientific research."

This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree attributes in Humanities and the International Cultures requirement. Through examinations of feature films and documentaries, the class explores how cinema approaches social, cultural, political, and economic realities in Brazil, Portugal, and Lusophone Africa. Students will learn about national histories, political struggles, social movements, and cultural practices of the Luso-Afro-Brazilian world as they gain the skills and appropriate vocabulary to analyze and discuss film. The course materials will invite students to consider how films examine legacies of imperialism, colonialism, and dictatorial regimes, as well as ongoing divisions and injustices on the basis of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Questions to be considered in this course include: How do filmmakers grapple with traumas of the past, questions of memory, and debates around truth and reconciliation? How do forms of fiction and documentary intersect, serve as complements, or contradict each other in film? How does film represent the convergences and divergences between different parts of the Portuguese-speaking world? What are the possibilities and limitations of studying these works in a comparative Lusophone framework? Readings on film, history, and Luso-Afro-Brazilian culture, and interviews with filmmakers will complement our studies of the films. The course will be conducted in English.

PPATH 544: Fungal Genetics,"Fungal breeding systems, mating types, asexual restrictions and recombination, tetrad analysis, gene conversion and extra genetic elements.   Fungal Genetics (4) Fungal genetics will focus on the classical genetics of fungi starting with the expected inheritance ratios and patterns for single gene and multiple genes on various fungal traits. The methods of establishing crosses and obtaining progeny will be covered in the examples provided. Mating type and breeding systems are an important trait for obtaining the sexual phase, therefore an emphasis will be placed on the genetic determination of breeding methods and mating type, and what is known of mating type switching. There are several unique phenotypes associated only with fungi (pokey, senescent fungi, killer character and others) inherited by mitochondrial DNA and induced by plasmids or transposons. The determination of inheritance and the importance will be examined. Fungi provide the unique opportunity to conduct tetrad analysis in determination of inheritance and mapping of traits. In the laboratory, crosses will be set up by students to obtain data to conduct tetrad analysis and to visualize unusual tetrads brought about by gene conversion. Exchange of genetic material occurs without the sexual cycle though heterokaryosis and the parasexual cycle but may be limited by vegetative incompatibility. These difficult concepts will be discussed as well as visualized by conducting experiments in the laboratory. In discussions, an emphasis will be placed on plant pathogenic fungi and inheritance of virulence which is an important plant pathogen trait. Finally topics on population genetics of fungi including determination of genetic diversity, allele frequencies, genotype frequencies will be studied. Evaluation of student performance will be based on problems sets provided throughout the semester, laboratory reports, student projects and presentations, and a final examination. The problem sets are designed to help students solve genetic problems based on the concepts learned in lecture. The laboratory experiments are designed to complement the lectures and allow students to visualize difficult concepts from lecture. Students will be assigned a plant pathogenic fungus and will explore the literature especially any relevant genetic information on that fungus. The final examination will focus on short answer questions requiring the student to synthesize information. The course will be offered every other spring semester even years.

Microbe-Plant Interactions: Plant Disease and Biological Control (3) Plant health in both natural and agricultural ecosystems is essential for sustaining human society and all other life forms on Earth. Plant disease epidemics are common and diverse and can have devastating effects on our population and economy by debilitating the ecosystems on which we depend. This course focuses on biological and environmental factors that influence microbe-plant interactions which in turn determine plant health and initiate plant disease epidemics. Developing strategies for maintaining healthy plants in both natural and agricultural ecosystems requires an understanding of pathogen and host biology, as well as the role of the environment in disease epidemiology. Students will learn about the survival and spread of important plant-infecting fungi, bacteria, phytoplasma, and viruses and how mechanisms for microbial pathogenicity are influenced by the environment. The final section of the course will focus on the use of beneficial microorganisms to maintain and improve plant health. Grades will be based on student performance on a wide variety of activities including labs, quizzes, seminar reports, and exams."

PPOL 503: Statistics for Public Policy I,"This course provides a foundation for both evaluating and conducting quantitative analysis of public policy. The first third of the course examines foundational issues of conducting quantitative analysis of public policy. It does so by reviewing the basic elements of the foundations of such analysis, including the logic of scientific analysis, issues of philosophy of science, measurement theory (validity and reliability), and the elements of research design associated with internal and external validity as they apply to designs common in policy analysis. The remaining two-thirds of the course sequentially examines the use of basic statistical techniques in public policy analysis, including descriptive statistics (frequency distributions, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion), probability (the normal, binomial, poisson and other probability distributions), inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, estimating population proportions, and testing differences between two groups), and the analysis of nominal and ordinal data (constructing and analyzing simple and control contingency tables). The course provides a foundation for studying more advanced quantitative analysis techniques, such as regression analysis and related techniques. Throughout the course, the several statistical analysis techniques will be examined through their application to typical public policy problems. The goal of the course is to enable students to become familiar with the basic elements of quantitative analysis of public policy, to enable them to evaluate statistical evidence bearing on public policy decisions, and to conduct basic statistical analysis on public policy questions, all of which are essential for professional careers in public policy."
PPOL 506: Statistics for Public Policy II,"This course prepares students for both evaluating and conducting quantitative analysis of public policy using regression and regression-like techniques of statistical analysis. It does so by reviewing the logic of simple and multiple regression and the inferences that can be drawn from such analysis about public policy questions. The course then reviews the detection of violations of the assumptions of the regression model (specification error, heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, collinearity, nonlinearity, nonadditivity, and measurement error), their implications for valid inference, and their correction using extensions of basic regression analysis. The course will also examine regression-like techniques for nominal and ordinal dependent variables and their statistical evaluation. Throughout the course, the several regression analysis techniques will be examined through their application to typical public policy problems. The goal of the course is to enable students to become familiar with the elements of quantitative analysis of public policy using regression analysis, to enable them to evaluate such evidence bearing on public policy decisions, and to conduct regression analysis on public policy questions, all of which are essential for professional careers in public policy."
PPOL 529: Business and Democracy Around the World,"How does business shape democracy? One may be tempted to respond to this question by focusing on the money that business steers into political campaigns. Yet this approach elides a broader understanding of the influence of business on democratic self-government. This course will examine the direct participation of business in politics and public governance through private responses to ""government failures"" in the provision of goods and services. Through this involvement, business reshapes how democracy works, and we will study several mechanisms by which it does this including distributive public policy and reconceiving the citizen as a customer. Our scope is global; both individual countries and international efforts will be examined. Students will gain important analytic skills by employing frameworks from economics, political science and related disciplines, and will develop a richer understanding of the role that business plays in our political life."
PPOL 553: Comparative Racial and Ethnic Politics,"Since its founding, the United States has had to balance the American creed of equality for all, on one hand, with racial inequality, on the other hand. Is this challenge something exclusive to the United States? This course will provide students the opportunity to analyze how race and ethnicity are constructed across the globe as well as how race and politics interact across state borders. Students will examine how race is constructed and racial ideologies are developed in several countries including the U.S., South Africa, France, Australia and Brazil. By the end of the semester, students should be able to fully engage and contribute to broad literatures on the politics and policy of race and racism. They should readily be able to answer questions such as: What role do countries and their institutions play in developing racial ideologies and racial hierarchies? What political purpose do ideologies such as ""racial democracy"" serve? How might social scientists best compare notions such as U.S.'s ""race problem,"" Latin America's ""shade problem"" and Europe's ""immigrant problem""? What are the perils of cross-border comparisons, and how, if possible, can social scientists account for state differences in their analyses? The major objectives of the course are to: (1) analyze the effects of historical, social, economic, cultural and global forces on the development of racial and ethnic politics in various countries; (2) define and critically analyze concepts relevant to the study of racial and ethnic politics; (3) identify, critique and apply major academic theories and debates regarding issues of race, ethnicity, inequality and reconciliation; (4) build analytical skills so that students will be able to effectively engage and communicate in public and scholarly discourse about race and ethnic politics; (5) improve writing skills, especially as they relate to manuscript and book reviews; (6) become cognizant of the difficulties that scholars must navigate as they approach topics related to the politics, race, ethnicity as well as comparative/cross-state analysis; and (7) develop a series of best practices to address methodological and theoretical challenges to studying race comparatively."
PPOL 597: Special Topics,Formal courses given on a topical or special interest subject which may be offered infrequently; several different topics may be taught in one year or semester.
PPOL 805: Bureaucracy and the Policy Process,"This course examines the role of bureaucracy in the public policy process. Bureaucracies are critical actors in the conceptualization of policy problems, formulating policy solutions, and implementing public policies, whether directly through government or via the market. Public agencies are also the locus of many public policy careers. We will analyze how public agencies and their employees at all levels of government survive and sometimes prosper within an intensely political environment. The course briefly examines the relationship between politics and policy as first developed in public administration as the politics/administration dichotomy, then via the concept of overhead democracy within political science, and finally in contemporary economics and political science via public choice theory and principal agent models. Second, to better understand this transition in approaches to understanding of bureaucracy, the course develops a working model of bureaucratic politics by examining the motivations of relevant actors and their complex political environment(s). And third, this model is employed to examine the enduring problem of political control of the bureaucracy, with emphasis on evaluating a number of alternative and competing institutional strategies designed to enhance control. This first of these strategies is via hierarchy as expressed via principal-agent analysis. After outlining the logic of agency theory, the course looks closely at the relationship between bureaucracy and political executives, legislators, courts, and non-governmental actors. This strategy of controlling bureaucracy in the policy process is then contrasted with three others: limited government, non-bureaucratic provision of services by quasi-markets, and competitive bureaucracy in which agencies are designed to compete with each other. The goals of the course are to become first broadly familiar with the issue of bureaucratic politics and then how this influences each stage of the policy process. Beyond that, the goals include an appreciation of the nature of the bureaucratic control problem and the various strategies designed to address it."
PPOL 807: Managing Public Organizations,"Public policies are more often than not designed by public sector organizations and implemented by them. To understand public policy, then, students must understand public sector organizations and the people who work in them, interact with them, or are served by them. All of these influence the substantive manner in which public policy is actually implemented and the quality of that implementation. Further, many public policy analysts move into line management positions as their careers develop. How well public sector organizations are managed, then, has a significant impact on public policy outcomes and policy analyst careers. This course considers a range of management issues operative in the daily work of public sector organizations. After first discussing the inherent link between public sector organizations and public policy and discussing how public and private sector organizations differ in regard to management, this discussion considers several broad characteristics that distinguish organizations. This includes organizational structures and cultures. It then addresses the roles of leadership and strategic planning in defining the management function. And last, the course surveys a broad range of persistent management issues with a bearing on public policy: managing the civil service system, motivating employees, organizational performance, contracts and networks, and citizen involvement. More dynamically, it examines the management of conflict, change and innovation, and the political environment. The goals of the course include developing both an understanding of the internal and external influences on public sector organizations as they implement public policies and an appreciation of the range of distinct management issues that influence policy outcomes."

Psychological Foundations of Leadership (3) Emerging organizational challenges underscore the criticality of leadership in successful organizational functioning - a trend that is as true for the corporate world as it is for non-profit and governmental institutions. Underlying the need for well-trained, effective leaders is the requirement that future leaders have a fundamental understanding of the psychological processes driving successful leadership. This course provides a broad exploration of the theoretical bases for understanding leadership. Specifically, in this course, students will have the opportunity to learn about the psychological, cognitive, and social foundations underpinning leadership thinking and theory. In particular, course readings and activities will explore traits associated with leadership, psychodynamic perspectives on leaders, skills and styles used by effective leaders, contingency approaches to leadership, the role of power and influence, leader-member exchanges, team-based leadership, transformational leadership, and servant and authentic leadership. By exploring these topics, students will improve their critical thinking about their roles as leaders and expand their skillset to operate more effectively as future leaders. Students will consolidate and demonstrate their understanding of and ability to apply conceptual bases of understanding leadership to analysis of leadership situations and to improving their own capacity for leadership by participating in a number of course activities. For example, students will learn to apply their learning about course topics such as psychological perspectives on leadership to real-world examples of leadership. Moreover, students will gain a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding effective leadership by reviewing representations of leadership in popular culture and carrying out activities that require reflection on those representations. Such deep understanding will be reinforced through exposure to relevant examples, discussion, and cases that emphasize the application of leadership models and theory to practice. Final writing assignments will serve as a vehicle for students to recognize and identify concepts such as leadership styles and types of leadership and to apply them to developing reflective awareness of the psychological processes that drive successful leadership. The conceptual framework for the course will be the psychological principles guiding the development and instantiation of successful leadership."

Specific topic in this course include: employee emotions and motivation, employee well-being, leadership and social influence, workplace diversity, and team-level processes and climate."
"PSY 539: Foundations of Behavior, Motivation, and Attitudes at Work","Students will examine the psychological and social processes underlying behavior, motivation, and attitudes in work settings.  Foundations of Behavior, Motivation, and Attitudes at Work (3) Ongoing changes in the nature of work (e.g., increasingly jobs are knowledge-based), the workforce (e.g., more diverse), and employee-organizational linkages (e.g., greater mobility of employees from organization to organization; increased employee responsibility for maintaining work-relevant skills and knowledge) result in increasing complexity and variability in individual motivation and attitudes at work that, in turn, lead to challenges for leaders in their attempts to influence and develop their employees. Knowledge of the many psychological factors affecting motivation and attitudes, and related skills in understanding the specific ones that may be relevant in a given organizational setting, are critical for effective leadership. This course will provide a broad exploration of research and theory concerning the psychological factors that underlie motivational and attitudinal processes related to human behavior in work and organizational settings. In particular, the course investigates both positive and dysfunctional work behaviors, and their causes and consequences; work attitudes, including job satisfaction and organizational commitment; work motivation theories, including need and trait approaches, behavioral approaches, and cognitive approaches; the role of work content and context and social factors on motivation and attitudes; the importance of aligning such factors to create a work environment supporting effective employees and work groups; and how the changing nature of work and organizations may impact the importance of these factors. The course will focus on the development of the students' ability to think critically about the complexity of factors that influence behavior and the wide range of individual differences in behavior, emotions, and thinking that occur even when individuals experience a common work environment. Building on these insights, students will learn to recognize and identify in specific work settings the situational conditions that may enhance and/or inhibit effective employee motivation, attitudes, and behavior. Students will also develop skill in aligning various organizational programs and policies to maximize the overall positive impact on effective employee behavior. Synthesis of the various theories and sets of research findings will be developed by the use of relevant examples, cases, and discussions that allow students to demonstrate their knowledge in relation to the development of leadership behaviors likely to be effective in various organizational situations."

PSYCH 120N: Knowing Right from Wrong,"""Knowing Right from Wrong"" provides a comprehensive understanding of the nature of moral ideas, beliefs, and behaviors in contemporary contexts. What roles do nature and nurture play in the development of moral sensibilities? How do moral emotions and moral reasoning interact to produce moral behavior? What defines moral character and how does it influence what we do? Is it possible to derive what ought to be done from what is known about the world? How do we respond when moral demands compete with another? How do our moral convictions color our perceptions of world events? Can individuals and groups with differing moral commitments communicate with one another and live together peacefully? The course integrates perspectives from philosophy, psychology, and sociology, and prepares students to think about (and act in) a world in which morality (and its linked concepts, such as judgment of others) plays an increasingly important social and political role. The course treats morality as both an aspirational concept and as an actual social practice, and focuses on three major themes: (1) the origins and development of moral reasoning and ethical systems, (2) the influence of moral emotions and moral intuitions on moral reasoning and behavior, and (3) the influence of social and contextual factors on moral behavior and expression. Integrating the philosopher's interest in ethics, with the psychologist's interest in the mind and body, and the sociologist's interest in groups, the course provides a comprehensive introduction to morality in contemporary society, and the ways in which it shapes the lives of people in everyday situations."

PSYCH 244: Introduction to the Psychology of Human Factors Engineering,"Human Factors Psychology is an area of psychology where the overall focus is the scientific study of human behavior and how it can be applied to the use, design and development of products and systems, Students will learn basic principles of how people process information, perceive and interact with the world in various circumstances, They will learn how psychologists conduct research on human thought and behavior in an effort to measure peoples' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. These basic principles will be illustrated and explored with a series of hands-on activities that relate the material to everyday life. Topics to be covered include research design and methods, sensation and perception, memory and language, and social psychology. Psychological principles from these areas will be used to discuss ways to improve the safety of tools and systems, reduce human error and increase user satisfaction. Students will also gain a better understanding of the influence of stress and workload on human performance. A major topic will be ways to develop reliable and valid evaluation techniques for assessing performance, safety and ease of use of systems. In order to design effective systems, individual differences in age, gender and culture must be taken into account. People in different regions of the world have cultural differences that influence the way they perceive the world and process information. These individual differences will be addressed throughout the semester. Topics are presented through a combination of lectures, readings, demonstrations, and in-class activities. Active learning elements such as library/internet research, writing activities, and collaborate learning experiences will be applied. Evaluation is on the basis of content-based quizzes, objective exams, brief written reports of hands-on exercises, and collaborative assignments."
PSYCH 246N: Human Factors in Design & Art,"Within human factors engineering, a critical component to the design of products is understanding the physical and cognitive elements of the human. Within artistic design are fundamental elements to all visual expression. Thus, every artist, designer and visual communicator needs an awareness of formal elements and principles, variations within forms, relationships among forms. We must be aware of the impact evoked within viewers and users by formal conditions. This course and topics within it are inherently interdisciplinary in nature and could not be accomplished as effectively on their own. Without art, we cannot understand the design process effectively. Without human factors psychology, we cannot understand the human behavior effectively. Human factors is a discipline within psychology that deals with how humans interact and understand their world. This is necessary in product design. Art focuses on the creative process of design and is essential as well."

This course provides an overview of the biological bases of behavior and includes a presentation of the research, theory, and application of this knowledge. Specific topics include the basic anatomy and physiology of the central and peripheral nervous system, neural transmission and the function of various neurotransmitters. The majority of the course will focus on how these basic processes contribute to the processing of information from the senses, simple and complex learning, and cognitive processes such as memory, and language. Topics will include cover brain development, developmental and acquired neuropsychological disorders and therapeutic techniques. Content is presented through a combination of lectures, readings, demonstrations, and in-class activities. A major goal of the course is to show how questions relating brain and neural function to behavior are addressed through empirical research. The course introduces students to theories, research, and procedures used in psychological research and practice. It also promotes thinking about how students can apply this knowledge to enhance their lives. After taking this course students will be able to explain the relationship between brain and behavior. They will make more informed decisions about participating in future psychology courses and gain a better appreciation of the science and profession of psychology."
PSYCH 261: Introduction to Psychology of Learning,"This course provides a general survey of the study of learning and behavior. It will focus on investigating historical and current learning perspectives, their respective research methods, and how each contributes to our understanding of both human and animal behavior. The course also provides an investigation of human and animal experiments and how those studies inform our understanding of learning principles. Students should expect to learn about the processes of classical and operant conditioning and other related phenomena. The course provides a foundation for further understanding of learning principles and prepares students to analyze and distinguish between different types of learning they will witness in their everyday life. Questions discussed would include, How are behaviors and habits formed or changed? How are many of our social behaviors reinforced or weakened? What are the limits of learning, if any? How do learning principles help us with devising clinical interventions and treatments? Students will be able to encounter new situations, both social and otherwise, apply learning principles they have studied, and have an enriched experience because of the application of that knowledge."
PSYCH 269: Evolutionary Psychology,"Survey of evolutionary perspectives in current psychological research.   Evolutionary Psychology (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.This course demonstrates how knowledge and principles from evolutionary biology are used to conduct research on the design of the human mind. The course explains how evolutionary psychologists identify adaptive problems faced by our ancestors and test hypotheses about psychological mechanisms designed by natural selection to solve these adaptive problems. The psychological mechanisms discussed are involved in phenomena such as perception and the control of activity, learning and cognition, mate selection and courting, development and parenting, altruism, aggression, and social structure. Evolutionary psychology is thus not a topic area such as perception, learning, or motivation, but rather a way of thinking that can be applied to any topic within psychology. The course, therefore, shows how evolutionary psychology is (1) changing how scientists approach old topics, (2) opening up new areas of research, and (3) beginning to provide a unifying framework for integrating the various subdisciplines of psychology. Students will learn to understand and evaluate evolutionary hypotheses about a range of topics in psychology and related social sciences. Evaluation will be based on a combination of methods, including for example traditional exams, written homework, papers, and participation in class and group discussions. The course is offered as a perspective that can be used to think about the subject matter in any particular content course in psychology. Students may choose this course to fulfill a requirement in the major."

"PUBPL 120N: State, Society, and Public Policy","Alexis de Tocqueville called association the ¿mother science¿ of politics and saw voluntary associations as a pillar of American democracy. These associations must compete in what might be called a moral economy of public policy that preserves the value of equality. This course brings together ideas from political philosophy, history, political science, communication, sociology and economics to address an important question: How have voluntary, nongovernmental associations come to shape and implement public policy? The class begins with the core concepts in political thought and traces them through to contemporary ideas about civil society that span the political spectrum. After critically assessing these ideas, we integrate them into a framework for understanding the process of making public policy."

RISE 500L: Responsible Conduct of Research in Life and Health Sciences,"Responsible conduct of research (RCR) is the foundation upon which science depends for rapid progress and appropriate allocation of credit for research accomplishments. In the life and health sciences there have been dramatic changes in the research environment over time that have led to high-stakes professional outcomes for research scientists: multi-million dollar research grants, high-visibility international awards, institutional prestige. Personal accomplishments are intricately tied up with these professional outcomes: career consequences (tenure, expanded research group, etc.), significant personal financial rewards (royalties, start-up companies, etc.), and personal prestige and recognition, among others. These increasing professional and personal pressures on research scientists can have very real impacts on the day-to-day decisions of scientists: appropriate data acquisition and management, proper allocation of credit, responsible use of animals, responsible work with human subjects, appropriate advising and mentoring of students, respect of intellectual property, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest and commitment. This course explores the ethical basis for the responsible conduct of research, and highlights the challenges faced by today's scientists. Students will learn about past failures in the responsible conduct of research that inform the current regulatory environment, understand the current expectations of biomedical scientists beyond the regulations, and, through the use of case studies, explore real ethical dilemmas for which there are not always easy answers. At the conclusion of this course, students will have both intellectual and practical resources to deal with ethical challenges they might face in their careers by making appropriate, ethical decisions."
RLST 111: Early Judaism,"Early Judaism will introduce students to the history of Judaism as reflected in Jewish literature from the period of the Babylonian exile (587/6 BCE) to the closure of the Babylonian Talmud (ca. 600 CE). This course will analyze the development of Judaism from its emergence out of the ancient Israelite religion through the formative period of rabbinic Judaism. Attention will be given to the diversity of ideas and practices that characterized early Judaism and the influence the larger Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman worlds had on Judaism's development. We will examine selections from the Hebrew Bible, and from other literature, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Apocrypha, the New Testament, the Mishnah, and the Talmudim."
RLST 114: Modern Judaism,"This course will explore the developments in Judaism since the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Major changes have come to the world since 1700-changes represented by terms such as the Enlightenment, Emancipation, Industrialization, Nationalism, Urbanization, Immigration, and Egalitarianism/Feminism. These broad social changes led to the break-up of traditional communities and, among other things, reformulations of Jewish Life and Jewish Religion. The effects can be seen in a number of Jewish responses-Assimilation, Hassidism, Self-Defense and Nationalism, Denominationalism, and Egalitarianism/Feminism-which we shall study in this class. In particular, we shall look at Jewish spirituality-its historical and theological development, its many historical and modern manifestations, and how it works."
RLST 121: Jesus the Jew,"Although Jesus of Nazareth is the object of Christian devotion, he was not a Christian himself, but a pious Jew. What can be known about the historical figure of Jesus the Palestinian Jew? How would his teachings and actions have fit in the context of Judaism of his day, in the Greco-Roman world? What did he mean when he proclaimed the coming kingdom of God? Because almost all of our source material espouses Jesus as the Christ of Christian faith, the first step is to understand the aims and perspectives of these Christian sources, including the canonical Gospels as well as non-canonical Gospels. Through careful examination of these sources in light of critical scholarship and the social and historical context of Judaism in the Greco-Roman world, we will consider how much the historian is able to reconstruct of Jesus using historical method, what the limits of this investigation are, and how relevant the task is. We will consider and evaluate a few of the different scholarly reconstructions of the historical Jesus. Major emphases will include the historical, social, religious, political, and cultural contexts of Jesus, including important precursors; the political, institutional, and cultural history of the teachings and actions of Jesus in their Jewish setting, and how these are reinterpreted by his followers after his death. Attention will be paid to the development of variant Christian traditions about Jesus including Jesus as Messiah, his death as a saving event, the resurrection as exaltation of Jesus as Lord, the memorialization of Jesus in Christian ritual practice, and the cultural and religious impact of Jesus throughout history. In addition to the early Christian sources on Jesus (especially the canonical Gospels, but also other New Testament texts and non-canonical writings), on each topic students will read selections from early Jewish writings in order to illuminate the cultural context. These include the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Jewish texts among the so-called Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, early rabbinic texts, and epigraphical writings. Relevant archeological evidence and Greco-Roman sources will also be considered. Broader issues of historical, cultural, linguistic, political and geographical context will be covered in lectures and secondary readings."
RLST 124: Early and Medieval Christianity,"This course provides an introduction to the history of Christianity. It traces, specifically, the development of the Christian movement from its beginnings as a small Jewish sect in Jerusalem to its unlikely emergence as the religion of the Roman Empire and, finally, its subsequent spread and development in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In form and structure, the course is historical, following figures and events in a more or less chronological sequence and taking up questions of causality, influence, and social identity. Yet the course is also concerned with the ideas, concepts, and philosophical viewpoints that have shaped Christianity and given it a certain intellectual coherence over time. The course begins with first-century construals of messianic identity and also with the figure of Jesus, as he was portrayed in the New Testament gospels. It then follows the first generations of the Christian movement, considering it within the context of first-century Judaism and the early Roman empire. Topics include persecution, martyrdom, and the important contributions of Origen. The middle section of the course looks at the second, third, and fourth centuries through three lenses, as it were: the office of bishop, the rise of monasticism, and the realities of empire. Bishops, monks, and emperors all shaped Christianity in essential ways, creating a rich and complicated spiritual, moral, theological, intellectual, and geo-political legacy for generations to come. The final third of the course looks at the development of Christianity beyond the fourth century in geographical groupings including churches in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, western Europe, Byzantium, and the Slavic lands. It is hoped, in all of this, that students will gain an understanding not only of Christian history but also of what made - and what makes - Christianity a distinctive and influential religion."
RLST 181: Introduction to the Religions of China and Japan,"A survey of the history, philosophy, and cultural impact of the major Far Eastern religions: Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shinto.  /  Introduction to the Religions of China and Japan (3)(GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.

It traces the evolution of the major traditions (Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism in China, as well as Shinto, Buddhism and Confucianism in Japan) by examining their ideas of humanity and nature, morality and society, and metaphysics and ethics. It also reveals the interaction and interrelation between ideology, politics and society, and their impact on the development of the major religious traditions in history. A major focus is the relation between the popular and folk practices and beliefs of esoteric Daoism, devotional Buddhism, and fertility-cult Shinto and the elite and literate doctrines and precepts of Confucianism, philosophical Daoism, and monastic Buddhism. The course also devotes some attention to the influence of religion on various facets of culture, such as medicine, science, literature, art and food. The objectives of the course are first to acquaint students with the religious beliefs, values, and practices of China and Japan by looking at their historical formations and contemporary manifestations, and second, to locate them in a global and comparative context."
RLST 194: Jerusalem: Sacred and Profane,"Jerusalem, a city sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, is often depicted as the spiritual and physical center of the world. Throughout its 5000-year history, Jerusalem has attracted diverse cultures, empires, and peoples who have vied for control of this city that is both religiously significant and a very ordinary site of urban life. Jerusalem: Sacred and Profane surveys the archaeological, religious, cultural, political, social, and historical record of Jerusalem in the ancient, medieval, and modern periods. We will explore a series of themes in the city¿s history: the built urban environment, political power in and over the city, sacred sites and pilgrimage, the everyday experiences of Jerusalemites, the changing cultural meanings of the city across various religious and national traditions, and war, violence, and memory in the urban landscape. The significance of Jerusalem's past, its impact on contemporary society and politics in the modern Middle East, and differing visions for this contested city's future are examined in light of various interpretations of the historical evidence."

What is the relationship of a particular anti-Semitism to the national culture in which it originates?We will be reading the major original texts of anti-Semitism from Roman and ancient writers, through early Christian texts and medieval Christian Blood Libels against the Jews, documents of the Spanish expulsion, Lutheran tracts, Voltaire's essays, German philosophical texts from Kant to Marx, Wagner's racial essays, the Protocols of Zion, and documents of Nazi anti-Semitism by Hitler and Streicher. The major part of the grade will depend on a short research paper which will be presented in various drafts, so that the final version represents the culmination of discussion and constructive criticism and advice. This course is a parallel course to J ST/ (Zionist History) and J ST/ (Modern Jewish History). This course will count toward the Religious Studies, Jewish Studies, and History majors and minors in the 400-level category."

RL ST (J ST/HIST) 424H (PHIL 434H) Monotheism and the Birth of the West (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Learn about the formation of Western culture, while learning to analyze the texts and other evidence about its formation from a critical, rather than naive, viewpoint. The idea of monotheism probably arose very early, and was even briefly implemented as a state cultic policy in Egypt in the 14th century BCE. Why, then, did it take another seven centuries to become widespread--appearing in ancient Judah, Babylon, and Ionia almost simultaneously? To answer this question, the course focuses on several developments, through the medium of primary texts and archaeology: the shift from a state hinterland based in extensive agriculture and household processing to one organized for intensive agriculture and industrial processing the rise of recognizably modern science; the promotion of individuation and an international elite culture in the context of Assyrian and Babylonian imperial ambitions; the development of the historical and archaeological arts in the context of archaizing in order to reinvent local traditions; and the socialization of monotheism and of democracy. Students will be evaluated on their discussion of the textual evidence as well as on reports in class and a final paper. This is the sole honors course treating the birth of the West. It expands on knowledge acquired in courses listed as prerequisites and in RL ST/CAMS/J ST 012; CAMS 044; ANTH/CAMS 133; CAMS/; ; HIST/J ST 102; and  and enriches the students experience in CAMS 400, CAMS 440, and ; HIST 402; J ST 411; ; , and .

Yet far from being limited to the vast, dark novels of legend, Russian literature offers a great deal of variety, including much humor, lyricism and fantasy. Russian 405 is a senior-level seminar devoted to the in-depth study of selected texts of classical nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature. It presupposes a solid reading knowledge of Russian. The choice of authors and texts will vary from one year to the next. Writers discussed on a regular basis will include such major figures as Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Lev Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, as well as selected writers from the Soviet and post-Soviet period.The thematic emphasis will vary from one year to the next. The focus may be on the oeuvre of a single writer, on the development of a particular genre (e.g., lyric poetry or the short story), on a particular time period (e.g., the so-called ""Silver Age"" at the beginning of the twentieth century), or a particular theme (e.g., the conflict between liberalism vs. radicalism, the ""woman question,"" the role of religion, Russia vs. the West, Russian ""Orientalism,"" the Communist Revolution and its discontents, etc.).The literary texts will be read in Russian. They will be analyzed both in their socio-historical context and as aesthetically compelling manifestations of verbal art. Explorative analytical writing and class discussion will be essential means to explore the subject matter."
RUS 412: Russian Translation,"Translation from Russian into English of complex texts from the humanities, social sciences, and technical fields."
RUS 414: Advanced Grammar and Linguistic Analysis of Contemporary Russian,"In-depth study of selected grammar topics pertaining to the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Modern Standard Russian with glimpses into the history of the Russian language.

SBN 508: Methods in Social and Behavioral Neuroscience,"Different sections of  will explore important topical areas in the broader domain of research design, experimental and measurement techniques, and data analytic methods that are common to Social and Behavioral Neuroscience or are newly developed, cutting edge methods in the field. Courses will include an examination of (a) the biological process being measured (e.g. what type of neural activity is and is not captured in fMRI), (b) the foundational principles of the experimental and/or measurement technique, (c) the analytical approaches pertinent to the type of data being generated, and (d) methodological issues of particular relevance to the experimental technique and/or design being used. The intent of  is to provide students with a strong foundation in research design, procedures,measurement, and data analytic approaches that students can carry forward and use in research projects in Social and Behavioral Neuroscience.  will emphasize class participation and provide multiple opportunities to examine related topics in written and spoken form. Courses will also provide students with the opportunity to work with the relevant data types to provide an immersive experience in design and analysis. We anticipate that  course sections will be continually revised and updated to reflect new and innovative experimental, measurement, and data analytical techniques that continually appear in the scientific literature."
SC 200: Science in Our World: Certainty and Controversy,"A science appreciation course, aimed at making non-scientists more informed consumers of science. Science is frequently in the news. That's because it affects our everyday lives, shapes our view of the world and our place in it, and will have a profound impact on our future. This course teaches an appreciation of science and scientific thinking. It is aimed at making non-scientists more informed consumers of science by improving their ability to distinguish good science from bad science, and science from non-science. Students will be evaluated in part on their analysis of news stories that appear during the course of the semester. The course assumes no background knowledge. It is not for future scientists. Content is delivered by case studies of controversies within science and/or the public domain, some of which are resolved, some of which are not. These case studies will vary by semester and instructor. The course illustrates general principles of science by studying arguments now largely resolved, but which still resonate, such as child health and IQ, smoking, and why the peacock has such a ridiculous tail. The course will also examine unresolved scientific controversies which might include personalized genetic medicine, passive smoking, nanotechnology, the effects of gun laws on violence and suicide, or deer management in Pennsylvania. The course will also evaluate unresolved scientific issues in the contemporary media: why it is in the news, what are the scientists involved actually doing and arguing about, and how is the media is handling the science? The course will include an analysis of media reaction to a scientific paper published by PSU faculty. The course will discuss paradigm shifts which have occurred during the students' lifetimes, particularly those involving our view of ourselves and our universe, and include speculation on the paradigm shifts that could occur in the next twenty years. The course will draw on experts from within and outside of PSU. Throughout, the focus is on the nature of the debates, looking at how scientists evaluate problems, and why that can generate controversy within science and beyond science-but at the same time, generate trustworthy knowledge which profoundly affects our well being and our understanding of ourselves."
SC 201: Medical Professions,"Learn about the different medical professions and related subjects.   Medical Professions (1)The purpose of this course is to provide students with general information on the different health professions and various related subjects as potential career options. Many students come to the university with an interest in pursing a health profession but do not have a clear idea of what kind of work is involved in the particular profession of their choice. Moreover, students often are not aware that there are other health career options available. This one-credit course is targeted to all students that have a general interest in health and science, and may include students in the following majors: premedicine, science, biology, chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, forensic science, nursing, kinesiology, nutrition, and biobehavioral health. Some of the professions discussed are: allopathic and osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, dentistry, maxillo-facial surgery, optometry, audiology, genetic counseling, nursing, podiatry, and pharmacy. In addition to describing the professions, time is spent talking about academic preparation for specific professions and the application process for admission to health profession schools. Furthermore, the nature of various health profession training programs are described , as well as how students obtain tuition funds for payment of such programs. One week's topic generally focuses on health profession training outside the United States (e.g., foreign medical schools). This course is structured as a seminar course; all lectures are given by invited speakers. The speakers talk about the profession in general and may give specific information about the particular school they attend or currently work at. Students are encouraged to ask questions about the health careers and also to interact with the speakers after the class, where they might ask specific questions pertaining to their suitability as an applicant. The course will meet in the evenings, for one hour, one day a week, for 15 weeks. The students that enroll in this course receive a satisfactory or unsatisfactory grade based on attendance only (there are no exams, quizzes or written reports). Students may miss up to three classes during the fifteen week session. Therefore, students that attend twelve of the fifteen lectures will receive a satisfactory grade. If a student needs to miss class due to an evening exam, they will need to fill out an Excused Absence Form, which can be obtained from the instructor (no other activities are excusable except for athletic competitions for students in varsity teams)."

Guest speakers will build upon this groundwork by leading modules on lesson planning for effective outreach and communicating with audiences through a variety of platforms, including social media, personal or professional blogs, media interviews, and press releases. These guest modules will be supplemented by panel discussions (with outreach and research professionals from Penn State) on science engagement in different settings (e.g., museums, extension meetings, public science lectures, K-12 classrooms, etc.), disseminating research via social media, and creating and integrating research-related outreach into broader impact statements for grant proposals. The design of student outreach projects will provide a unifying thread throughout the semester, as students work in small groups to create, refine, and implement unique outreach activities following best practices outlined in lectures and panel discussions. Students will be encouraged to choose topics outside of their normal studies, expanding their ability to communicate science with which they are less familiar. Students will have multiple opportunities to both receive feedback from their peers and instructors and offer feedback on their peers¿ projects. Students will exhibit their activities at an event, and in doing so, practice the communication and engagement skills they developed throughout the semester. Through this process, students will gain experience disseminating science, as well as confidence in their ability to accomplish successful science outreach. Afterward, students will evaluate and reflect on their experience and use this self-evaluation to refine their activities for future use."
SCIED 116: Introduction to Astronomy for Educators,"This course is designed to engage students with the big ideas of astronomy in ways that will help them understand both the content of astronomy, as well as the practices of science as carried out by astronomers. The course is designed for prospective elementary and middle school teachers (PK-4 and 4-8 majors), although it is available to other non-science majors. Throughout the course, students engage in a series of investigations that lead towards the development of evidence-based explanations for patterns observed in the current Solar System. Investigations will include computer-based simulations, night-sky observations, and use of simple laboratory equipment. These investigations lead students towards an understanding of how observations of the current Solar System can be explained by the model of its formation. The course is designed to build from students' own personal observations of the day and night sky towards developing increasingly sophisticated explanations for those phenomena and beyond. Conducting these astronomy investigations will help students understand fundamental aspects of physics, thus broadly preparing them for future science teaching in these domains.

SOC 119 has three objectives. First, the course will introduce students to new ways of thinking about race, ethnicity and culture from the perspectives of the social sciences and humanities. Students will be able to compare and contrast differences between race, ethnicity and culture. They will be able to understand the extent and pervasiveness of racial, ethnic and cultural inequality and discrimination in the U.S. and explain how unequal systems impact different ancestry groups both in the U.S. and around the world. Students will be able to compare historical causes and consequences of sociological processes such as immigration, assimilation and multiculturalism, and they will develop new ways of understanding how these processes are expressed in popular culture (e.g., art, music, literature) and intergroup dynamics. The second objective is to provide students with the intellectual tools for having more thoughtful conversations about the issues address in the class. By acquiring these tools Students will be able to formulate more thoughtful questions and responses when they engage others in everyday discussions about the many racial, ethnic and cultural factors and forces that pull people and groups together and push them apart. The third objective is to encourage students to explore their own racial and cultural identity. Students will explore pathways to allow them to discover new ways to understand their own racial and ethnic place in the world and the history of their own families. Students will be able to more clearly explain how their identity reflects and shapes their life experiences as well as others in their racial and ethnic group(s)."
SOC 15: Urban Sociology,"City growth and decline; impact of city life on individuals, families, neighborhoods, and government; urban life-styles."
SOC 162N: Communicating Care,"Communicating Care  /  /  What do we talk about when we talk about health? Our states of well-being and illness are topics that, like the weather, drive our daily conversations, but we rarely have time to study and practice these vital exchanges. Spoken in emergency rooms or on long-distance calls, by medical professionals, family members, or strangers making small talk, the languages we use to share pain and recovery require our knowledge of long-established scripts and our willingness to improvise. By exploring how these encounters draw from and work as textual and dramatic performances, this course will guide students to achieve a new level of literacy in the most essential communicative art of caring. Students will analyze health conversations in literary texts, such as short stories, poems, memoirs, and graphic novels. They will explore real-life scenarios drawn from their own experiences, fieldwork, social science theories, and published case studies. Developing skills in the humanities (GH), they will see how subjective, often individual experience, historical perspectives, and creative expression help people to communicate about health and care. Developing their abilities in the social and behavioral sciences (GS), they will see how theory provides insights to predict and understand health and practices of care, investigate objective perspectives and recognize the contributions of fieldwork and data-driven studies to analyzing and improving communication when health is a main concern. They will integrate these methodologies especially to pursue these fields' common goals of making beneficial connections between individuals and groups, and managing private and public life."
SOC 201: Presumed Innocent? Social Science of Wrongful Conviction,"The criminal justice system is a human creation and some errors are expected. Sometimes guilty parties go free and sometimes innocent people are convicted. In this course, we will employ the perspective of the social scientist to understand why and how wrongful convictions occur. How can social science help to predict, explain, and prevent wrongful convictions? This course is organized into three units. In the first unit, we will examine the large body of social science research that demonstrates disparities in all stages of the criminal justice system. For example, young Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. This is partly due to these men disproportionately living in environments that foster crime, but social science research shows sometimes it's also partly due to the discretionary decisions of police, prosecutors, and courts. As a result, these demographic groups are most likely to be wrongfully convicted. In the second unit, we'll explore the factors in the justice system that might lead to a wrongful conviction, including false confessions, eyewitness misidentification, poor legal representation, government misconduct, and informants and snitches. Social scientific findings elucidate how each of these factors influence conviction accuracy. Finally, we'll discuss how social science research on the risks and factors that contribute to wrongful convictions can be used to improve policies to reduce the risk of such convictions. Simple reforms such as openness about plea-bargaining, eyewitness identification reform (e.g., sequential lineups, double-blind procedures, etc.), recording of interrogations, and introducing Innocence Commissions in every state can improve our criminal justice system."
SOC 205N: Critical Race Theory in the Humanities and Social Sciences,"This course closely examines the place and power of race in America. By tracing the history of how race works in particular American institutions, such as public education, criminal justice, and federal housing, students will gain a deep sense of how social categories and understandings shape material conditions and human welfare. Through the study of policies, court cases, memoirs, documentary films, and freedom struggles, this course will interrogate the many Americas that race has created and their implications for democracy and justice. Not only will this course focus on making race visible, but also the many ways that race intersects with class, gender, and sexuality and how these concepts empower and marginalize at the same time. All the while, students will use Critical Race Theory methods to reach empathy and strengthen social (GS) and historical (GH) literacies. Discussion, writing, critical reading, and primary source analysis will be integral to this class. Class sessions will include whole- and small-group discussion where active listening and thoughtful participation will be taught and required. Students will be encouraged to explore their own conceptions of race and how those ideas shape knowledge and experience. Ultimately, this is a course that will weave data, theory, and story as we encourage students to move toward empathy through comprehensive understandings of race. This course therefore examines race as both deeply personal and structural."
SOC 208N: Visual Representations of the Middle East in the US and Middle East,"This course is an introduction to the visual culture, the visual experience and sociological/historical context of images of the Middle East in the US mass media. The focus of the course will be on reading and interpreting visual images (painting, photography, film, illustration, digital media) and analyzing the larger social and cultural forces that shape the production, distribution and consumption of these media forms. We will explore these issues by focusing on a series of images/case studies located in a specific historical context, allowing us to introduce some of the major movements in visual culture, explore the social contexts of these images, and the ways in which the visual experience shapes our social lives and personal identities. Course evaluations will include exams, writing assignments, a class blog, and a final art project. The course examines visual representations of cultures over time, providing students with the artistic, historical, political and sociological context of their production. This integrative framework will enable students to understand how the creation of visual media and its interpretations both influence and are influenced by social context. It will introduce students to integrative thinking by providing them with interpretive techniques of the social sciences and the arts to increase their powers of visual analysis so that they can discuss an image's medium, composition, style and iconography. The course will examine the ways that the arts can be an expression of cultural values, helping students to comprehend the hegemonic aspects of image composition, production, exhibition and distribution. The course will explore the social milieus in which media is created, often depicting stereotypical images that poorly represent the complexity of the myriad cultural groups in the Middle East."
SOC 210Z: Social Determinants of Health,"How is it that the United States spends more on medical care than any other country and yet ranks poorly on many indicators of health and well-being? Why are there so many and important health disparities across different population groups within the United States? How do our social, economic and political conditions ""get under the skin"" to affect our health and well-being? These kinds of questions are fundamental in the growing interdisciplinary field of population health and will be addressed in this course. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the social factors that influence health, such as race, class, gender, social networks, families, and public policies. We will explore the range of broader social factors that influence health, key sociological concepts and theories that help us understand these processes, and methods used to study them. The course will enhance student education and engagement in the area of vulnerable populations and health equity. After taking this course, students will be able to: - Describe the social and economic factors that influence health and disease patterns - Describe and discuss the social and economic factors that contribute to health inequalities across populations, particularly in the United States - Understand the important role social determinants play in the health of individuals and society  and  are linked"

SOC 30: Sociology of the Family,"This course examines the family in American society by looking at individually lived family experience, the family as a systematic social institution influenced by larger social processes and social structure and context, and the ways in which family patterns and processes influence broader social patterns. Students will learn how researchers resolve issues related to the definition of family; how researchers develop theories and conduct research on family issues; how family experiences are shaped by factors such as race/ethnicity, social class, and the larger social context; how the key stages of the family life course and family challenges may be experienced by individuals and influenced by the larger social context; how family choices and processes impact the larger society. The course both provides a foundation for further study in both general sociology and sociology of the family, and prepares students to make informed choices about their future family-related issues. Throughout the course students are empowered to reflect on their individual experiences, and to link individual experience to the larger social context and the family as a key social institution."

SOC 411: Racial and Ethnic Diversity and the American Family,"This course will explore the nature and determinants of racial and ethnic variation in family processes in the United States.  HD FS 416 () Racial and Ethnic Diversity and the American Family (3) During the last several decades, the racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population has changed dramatically. At end of the 20th century, non-Hispanic whites accounted for less than 75 percent of the U.S. population. While blacks remained the largest minority group, there were nearly as many Hispanics as blacks, and the number of Asians was increasing. Population projections indicate that by the middle of the 21st century, Hispanics will make up nearly one-fourth of the U.S. population. Blacks, Asians, and American Indians together will comprise an additional fourth of the population. The last several decades have also brought significant changes in family life in the United States, including declining rates of marriage, a rising age-at-marriage, an increase in cohabitation, and a dramatic rise in the proportion of births outside of marriage. While these trends in family life have been experienced by all racial and ethnic groups, there is substantial variation in family patterns by race and ethnicity. The course will build on other courses in social inequality and the family. The course does not overlap with any existing courses in the Department of Sociology or with courses offered in other relevant departments.This course will explore the nature and determinants of racial and ethnic variation in family processes in the United States. The student will read articles from major sociological journals and learn to extract major points and issues. He/she will learn to synthesize and critique various arguments on major issues in the field. The student will acquire skills in summarizing and evaluating arguments in essay form. He/she will also develop oral presentation skills. Final grades for the course will be based on class participation, a brief (approximately 5 pages) paper, a group presentation, a midterm examination (essay format) and a final examination (essay format). The course is not required for the Sociology minor or major. However, the course can count as one of the 400-level elective courses in Sociology for the Sociology minor, B.A. or B.S."

"SOC 457: Jewish Communities: Identity, Survival, and Transformation in Unexpected   Places","Examines the global array of smaller Jewish communities that have flourished outside the main urban centers of Jewish settlement.  /  /  Jewish Communities: Identity, Survival, and Transformation in Unexpected Places (3) (US;IL) This course addresses an understudied aspect of Jewish experience. It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change. This course will explore the significance of small, little-known, idiosyncratic, and anomalous Jewish communities on Jewish history and culture, and draw on them to instruct students on the social and cultural processes of small or unusual communities generally. The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another. The social world of Jewish communities, large and small, is a core interest of Penn State's Jewish Studies Program. This course will complement the current offerings in Jewish Studies, strengthening the social, cultural, and contemporary perspectives available in the Program. It will provide students with an opportunity to explore individual experience and micro-level processes among Jews, and to study the dynamics of identity and survival. It will complement the current offerings in Sociology and Anthropology by affording an opportunity to focus on community-level social processes and by adding a course on contemporary Jewry. The course will integrate knowledge from a variety of sources and fields, promote intercultural understanding, and meet US and IL requirements. Materials will be interdisciplinary, and will include ethnographies, sociological studies, population studies, histories, and personal narratives. They will include primary texts, creative works, and scholarly analyses. The assignments will be structured to facilitate preliminary experience in independent analysis, library research, or field research. The course will be offered approximately once a year. Enrollment will be limited to 30 students in order to promote active, engaged learning. Evaluations will be based on short papers and outlines that will prepare students for their final, term papers."

SOC (CRIM) 512 Criminological Theories (3) This graduate course in Criminological Theories is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the major theories that have animated the field of criminology since its inception. The course traces the development of criminological theories from the early 20th century to the present and provides students with a targeted exposure to empirical studies that have tested these theories."
SOC 516: Education and Demographic Change,"Education is one of the most important factors affecting major demographic shifts and processes worldwide, including the first and second demographic transitions. If, as the old sociological adage goes ""demography is destiny,"" then our destiny is educationally transformed demography.  Interdisciplinary research across demography, sociology, neuropsychology, and epidemiology is developing a strong research literature about how the thinking style, behavior, and attitudes of the educated human radically change fundamental dynamics underlying the world's population. The whole way in which we come to our jobs, spouses, and lifestyles; how many children we have and how we raise them; how long we are likely to live, and what will be our eventual demise are all heavily influenced by how much education we have had. The collective force of widespread education and its influence on rising cognitive abilities, scripts for living, and economic well-being are creating a distinctly new type of human population with major benefits and future challenges for a sustainable human population.  At the same time, individuals' schooling is also influenced by demographic change. This seminar covers key concepts, theories, and methodological issues related to the intersection of demographical and cultural changes from the education revolution and their impact on subsequent demographic processes."
SOC 533: Sociology of Religion Seminar,A survey of the sociology of religion designed to help students conduct and critique social science research.
SOC 544: Current Issues in Complex Organizations,"Critical survey of recent developments in sociological study of organizations and the theory of bureaucracy, including reciprocal effects on environments."
SOC 552: Economic Sociology,"This course serves as a graduate-level survey of the field of economic sociology. While encompassing a variety of theoretical and methodological orientations, economic sociologists seek broadly to understand the role of social forces in the organization of economic life. As such, theory and research in economic sociology extends, refines, and sometimes critiques complementary perspectives from economics, management, psychology, industrial organization, and other social science fields. The topics emphasized in the course will include the ""embeddedness"" of economic action in social structure; the role of institutional logics and myths in economic and organizational behavior; structure and change in markets and organizational fields; the role of politics in the economy; how social networks affect economic activity; the role of culture in economic action; patterns of consumption and valuation; trust and uncertainty; and the diffusion of innovations. By the end of the course, students should have a broad understanding of the field of economic sociology and be able to apply knowledge from this field in their own research."
SOC 560: Urban Sociology,"Examination of the structure and dynamics of North American cities and of residents' experiences in such settings.   Urban Sociology (3) The major objective of Sociology 560 (formerly 597F) is to survey the field of urban sociology, providing graduate students with a solid grounding in the literature on North American cities. The course heavily emphasizes recent writings by sociologists. However, the historical development and continuity of the major questions that have guided urban research receive more than passing attention, as do the contributions of geographers, psychologists, and others outside the discipline. A broad range of theoretical perspectives, substantive topics, and methodological strategies are through reading, lecture, and discussion. Students are expected to be active, critical consumers of urban knowledge but also producers of it: they must independently formulate and address a research problem then share their results with their classmates. Once students complete Sociology 560, they should be ready to enroll in more specialized urban seminars and to teach urban sociology at the undergraduate level."
SOC 595: Internship in Political Science,"Supervised off-campus, nongroup instruction, including field experiences, practicums, or internships.  Written and oral critique of activity required."
SOCW 301: Social Work Methods - Groups,"The primary focus of this course is to introduce students to the importance of group work with a variety of client populations as well as provide a foundation in group work theories, modalities and facilitation. Social work students are in many instances most often comfortable working with individuals or family units and have little to no experience in group leadership. Since group work regularly occurs within a micro or clinical context as well as in larger macro practice settings it is imperative that social work students become familiar with and proficient in group work. This course discusses planning for, conducting, and evaluating several types of groups including skills, support, treatment, psychoeducational, task orientated, macro practice, anti-oppressive, eating disorder, elementary school conflict resolution and teen pregnancy groups. Additional group work with disenfranchised populations including immigrants and people with HIV/AIDS. Students will be asked to apply critical thinking to inform and communicate professional judgments. The course will be framed within eight of the nine competencies and practice behaviors as outlined by the Council for Social work Education that are appropriate for an advanced level course."
SOCW 303: Methods - Communities & Organizations,"This course will examine the interventions, research, and theories that generalist social workers use in macro practice settings while working with communities, groups, organizations, and public policy. Students will develop skills in community activism, advocacy, development, empowerment, mobilizing, organizing, and organizational leadership.  students will also learn how to create a community action plan, needs assessment, program budget, grant proposal, logic model, and SWOT analysis to further develop administrative and leadership skills. As a course requirement, students will be expected to engage with communities and organizations outside of the classroom. Therefore, the following background clearances may be required: PA child abuse clearance, PA criminal background check, and an IdentoGO/FBI fingerprint clearance. Upon successful completion of this course, students will foster a better understanding of how macro-level social workers employ various approaches to engage, assess, intervene, and evaluate diverse populations and organizations from a generalist practice perspective."
SODA 501: Big Social Data: Approaches and Issues,"Interdisciplinary integration of computational, informational, statistical, visual analytic, and social scientific approaches to the creation of big social data. This course addresses computational, informational, statistical, visual analytic, and social scientific approaches to the creation of data that are both ""social"" (about, or arising from, human interactions) and big (of sufficient scale, variety, or complexity to strain the informational, computational, or cognitive limits of conventional social scientific approaches to data collection or analysis). Examples include text, image, audio, video, intensive spatial and/or longitudinal data, data with complex network, hierarchical and/or other relational information, data from distributed sensors and mobile devices, digitized archival data, and data exhaust from sources like social media. Possible topics include sources of social data, data structures and formats for social data, data collection and manipulation technologies, data linkage and alignment, ethics and scientific responsibility in human subjects research, experimental and observational data collection design for causal inference, measurement of latent social concepts, reliability and validity, search and information retrieval, nonrelational and distributed databases, and standards for data preservation and sharing."

"SRA 471: Informatics, Risk, and the Post-Modern World","Provides in-depth study of how security informatics is influenced by the risk and post-modern culture.   Informatics, Risk, and the Post-Modern World (3)The post-modern world provides a changing climate and context for defining and understanding threats, intelligence, decisions, and risk. Likewise, post-modern cultures consist of beliefs that are heavily influenced by psychology, social connectivity, collective behavior, religion, ethnicity, and political systems. This system of systems is heavily dependent upon and influenced by information, information technology, and the web (social informatics). When examining human behavior as it impacts risk, these various social-technical factors must be considered in planning for terrorism, intelligence analysis, and emergency events. As the post-modern world becomes increasingly complicated, the ability to discern, identify, and address threats in terms of risk becomes exceedingly more difficult. Provision of learning underlying psychological, social, political, religious, and technical components of how risk accelerates through various stages will be critical for protection of national and international interests within the security sphere. Security informatics will be at the heart of both recognizing emerging situations and employing tools/agents/measures to assuage emergency, terrorist, or even national disaster events. This course provides the student with a broad perspective to critically examine both theories and practice of security informatics as related to the cultures in which threats emerge asymmetrically. Students will be placed on the role of systems analysts to problem solve and analyze information from a broad bandwidth of information specifically as informed by culture, post-modern thought, psychological intent, and situation awareness. The course will be grounded by participation in case studies and/or analyzing exercises of risk. Students will be required to do comprehensive reading assignments, engage in team cognition-social interaction, and become familiar with social informatics concepts and tools as related to risk, terrorism, and information warfare. As the post-modern world becomes increasingly complicated, the ability to discern, identify, and address threats in terms of risk becomes exceedingly more difficult. Provision of understanding some of the underlying psychological, social, political, religious, and technical components of how risk accelerates through various stages will be critical for protection of national and international interests within the security sphere. As extreme events become more prevalent in society, security informatics will be at the heart of both recognizing emerging situations and employing tools/agents to assuage emergency, terrorist, or even national disaster events."

SSED 537: Teaching Citizenship for Civic Engagement,"This course explores citizenship education for civic engagement. Lessons revolve around three essential questions culled from the research literature: What kind of citizens and civic engagement does a 21st century democracy need? What should these citizens know, believe, and be able to do? What practices, programs, and structures in educational settings promote active citizenship? Activities and written assignments work to answer each of these questions, encouraging students to grapple with competing theories of citizenship that have shaped citizenship education programs in schools and universities. Course exercises will give students opportunities to think about and weigh their commitment to different definitions and theories of democracy, civic engagement, and citizenship. Students will analyze how educators have put those definitions and theories into practice across educational settings. In analyzing how civic engagement can be fostered across the educational lifespan-from the earliest grades to university education-students should take note of commonalities in approach as well as age-appropriate differences."

STAT 557: Data Mining I,"This course introduces data mining and statistical/machine learning, and their applications in information retrieval, database management, and image analysis.  Data Mining I With rapid advances in information technology, we have witnessed an explosive growth in our capabilities to generate and collect data in the last decade. In the business world, very large databases on commercial transactions have been generated by retailers. Huge amount of scientific data have been generated in various fields as well. For instance, the human genome database project has collected gigabytes of data on the human genetic code. The World Wide Web provides another example with billions of web pages consisting of textual and multimedia information that are used by millions of people. How to analyze huge bodies of data so that they can be understood and used efficiently remains a challenging problem. Data mining addresses this problem by providing techniques and software to automate the analysis and exploration of large complex data sets. Research on data mining have been pursued by researchers in a wide variety of fields, including statistics, machine learning, database management and data visualization. This course on data mining will cover methodology, major software tools and applications in this field. By introducing principal ideas in statistical learning, the course will help students to understand conceptual underpinnings of methods in data mining. Considerable amount of effort will also be put on computational aspects of algorithm implementation. To make an algorithm efficient for handling very large scale data sets, issues such as algorithm scalability need to be carefully analyzed. Data mining and learning techniques developed in fields other than statistics, e.g., machine learning and signal processing, will also be introduced. Example topics include linear classification/regression, logistic regression, model regularization, dimension reduction, prototype methods, decision trees, mixture models, and hidden Markov models. Students will be required to work on projects to practice applying existing software and to a certain extent, developing their own algorithms. Classes will be provided in three forms: lecture, project discussion, and special topic survey/research applications. Project discussion will enable students to share and compare ideas with each other and to receive specific guidance from the instructors. Efforts will be made to help students formulate real-world problems into mathematical models so that suitable algorithms can be applied with consideration of computational constraints. By surveying special topics, students will be exposed to massive literature and become more aware of recent research.

STS 123: History of Science II,"A history of science and culture from the scientific revolution to the present.  S T S (HIST) 123 History of Science II (3) (GH) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.The purpose of this course is to explore the earliest developments in science, beginning with the prehistoric roots of technology and theories of human origins, followed by an engagement with the achievements of the Mayans, Aztecs, and native North Americans. We then turn to science and technology in the ancient Greek Egyptian worlds, followed by an analysis of early Chinese and East Indian science, medieval science in Europe, selected African sciences, and the rise of modern science in the Scientific Revolution and beyond. The point of the course is to show that science is a world tradition with an ancient history, and that many social, political, cultural, and economic forces can push or pull this peculiar form of knowing in one direction rather than another. There are other history of science courses offered at Penn State, but none treats the history of science in general in relation to its social context and influences. Other history of science courses are more thematic than survey courses (e.g., 'History of Mathematics' and 'History of Gender in Science and Archaeostronomy'). , 'History of Science I,' treats science from Stonehenge to the scientific revolution. Students may take either course alone or out of sequence; the first will not be a prerequisite for the second. The expectation is that students will combine knowledge acquired in this course with knowledge from their required general education courses in science to develop a broader understanding of history and science. HIST/S T S 123 may be used to fulfill a requirement for the History major and the History minor and it is an essential part of the recently proposed science and technology history theme within the Science, Technology and Society minor. Students will learn historical techniques for the objective evaluation of readings and the formulation of clear and valid responses. Students' grades will be formed from a combination of a midterm and a final. Students are also required to do a paper for the class, the topic being subject to the approval of the instructor."
STS 235: Science and Religion,"This course investigates the relationship between science and religion in multiple cultures.  S T S 235 Science and Religion (3) (GH)The purpose of this course, designed to fulfill general education requirements in the humanities (GH), is to encourage students to investigate the relationships between the disciplines of science and religion. While most of the emphasis of the course will be on the historical interaction between science and Western religion, we will also investigate science ('natural philosophy') in the Islamic, Hindu, and Eastern religious traditions. Students will read classic texts that discuss science and religion from scientists such as Newton and Darwin as well as from world Scriptures and contemporary positions of various influential scientists and religious scholars concerning views of the material world as it relates to the spiritual world. There will be no attempt to encourage students to accept a particular religious or secular viewpoint. Rather, the course will be successful if at its conclusion the student can articulate a personal viewpoint while appreciating the reasons others might have for holding alternative opinions. Students will develop an understanding of the arguments and the historical context in which they originated which lead to differing positions. Thus, individual students will be expected to demonstrate this understanding in a series of examinations scheduled throughout the semester, and in a final examination if required by the instructor. Discussion and debate are useful devices in the search for understanding. In order to facilitate such discussion, students will be required to make one presentation to the class on an assigned topic. This presentation will serve as the starting point for class exploration of the topic. To encourage active and collaborative learning, the student presentations may be group efforts, however, no group will consist of more than three students."
STS 408: Cultural Foundations of Communications,"Examination of oral, scribal, print, industrial, and electronic cultures; analysis of impact of technology on communications and social structure.   /  Cultural Foundations of Communications (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.  /  traces the development of communications technologies and their impact on culture over the last 500 years. Students will examine how different tools for communicating changed the way people organized and made sense of their worlds. The course begins by looking at oral cultures and moves on to the scribal, print, industrial, electronic and post-industrial or postmodern cultures, studying the media developments that marked each of these eras. With each period and its corresponding technology students will examine how and why the new media altered not only the form of communication (the type of speech, form of writing and/or speed of information transfer), but also how such changes altered the content of knowledge (how people made sense of their lives and communities). Readings are drawn from a range of disciplinary perspectives on the issues, from history, sociology and anthropology, to philosophy, communication studies and cultural theory. The historical and theoretical knowledge provided by the course will give students a solid foundation for coming to terms with media trends in present-day society and for thinking through their possible epistemological, political and cultural impacts.The course is a communications elective for the Journalism and Telecommunications majors and the Media Studies minor."

SUR 212: Route and Construction Surveying,"Circular, compound, spiral horizontal curves; equal, unequal tangent vertical curves; alignments, earthwork; control, building, pipe, street, and as-built construction surveys.   Route and Construction Surveying (4)  builds directly upon the fundamental surveying principles presented in  (Plane Surveying), particularly traverse methods and coordinate geometry calculations. The course covers the fundamental geometric computations for street alignment design starting with simple circular, compound circular and spiral horizontal curves. This includes computation for intersection angles, radius, length, tangents, degree of curvature, stationing and stake-out calculations using coordinate geometry methods. The topics of vertical curve analysis follow which includes street grade, rate of change of grade, stationing, low and high points, passing a curve through fixed point and other alignment related analysis and design. Both equal tangent and unequal tangent vertical curves are discussed. Vertical curves are followed by street cross-sections, templates, slope stake locations, cut/full, earthwork computations and other aspects of 3-D alignment design. Once curve geometry and street alignment calculations are covered, the course moves into field stake-out methods for construction. Street alignment stake-out is covered first, using industry standard software with traditional and RTK-GPS equipment. A road alignment project is used to combine the aspects of geometric analysis and design with field stake-out methods including a control survey. Beyond street stake-out, other construction surveys are addressed including building, pipe line, culverts, storm and sanitary sewers, as-built and other construction related surveys. The laboratory exercises present field methods for construction projects in accordance with design specifications. Computations of earthwork volumes are also covered for other construction projects beyond that of street alignments."

The course will focus equally on feminist issues in both the US and on a global scale and is both interdisciplinary (drawing information and readings from history, psychology, political science, and sociology) and broadly inclusive (addressing at all times the relationship between gender, race, class, ethnicity and sexual orientation)."
WMNST 117: Women in United States History,"/  provides students with an overview of the most important historical developments in the history of women in the United States, including women's actual experiences as members of a class, a race, and an ethnic community, the progress women have made as individuals, workers, and citizens as well as the opposition they have faced. While ¿knowing the facts¿ is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or ¿order¿ to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of American women. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped the history of women in the United States. (3) Students will learn how to ¿think historically¿ by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of United States women¿s history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of American women. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped the history of American women and continue to shape the modern United States."
WMNST 194: Women Writers,"Short stories, novels, poetry, drama, and essays by English, American, and other English-speaking women writers. ENGL (WMNST) 194 Women Writers (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. English 194 will constitute a wide ranging study of works by American, British, and other English-speaking women writers, including novels, short stories, poems, plays, and prose. The class will approach this literature from a variety of thematic, historical, and/or generic vantages. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Bradstreet, Wollstonecraft, C. Rosefti, M. Shelley, Austen, C. Bronte, E. Bronte, G. Eliot, D. Wordsworth, Dickinson, Wharton, Stowe, Freeman, Jewett, Fuller, H.D., Moore, Sitwell, Bishop, Brooks, Plath, Cather, Woolf, Stein, Lessing, Bowen, O'Connor, Welty, Porter, Oates, Olsen, Sarton, Gordimer, Atwood, Morrison, Kinkaid, McCarthy, and Churchill. The course seeks to make students aware of the extensive body of literature written by women through the analysis, evaluation, and appreciation of specific works by women writers. The course also seeks to help students understand the female perspectives-the varying values and interests of women--reflected in the texts at hand and to position these perspectives within wider social, historical, and political contexts. The course also seeks to make students aware of the special problems faced by both women writers and the female inhabitants of the societies they describe in their work. As a course in women's literature, ENGL/ concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include a chronological introduction to the development of women's literature, a consideration of a principle theme or themes common to women's literature through a number of works from across a number of historical periods, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of historical events central to their creation, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of formal or aesthetic elements common to those works and their various effects. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in women's literature as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts."
WMNST 1: Introduction to Women's Studies,Interdisciplinary consideration of the scholarly theories and research pertaining to women's experiences and women's status in contemporary American society.
WMNST 200: Global Feminisms,"This course introduces students to the complexity of feminisms in the context of contemporary globalization. Much of the course focuses on the variety of feminist movement transnationally, particularly as those movements respond to not only local culture and politics, but also to global politics, and as such it touches again and again on the history of power. Explorations of the interanimating systems of power in a given area or region includes attention to ideologies of gender, race, sexuality, colonialism, imperialism, health and welfare, any or all of which are either supported or disrupted by globalism. The course holds a feminist lens to issues such as: gender and sexualities; the politics of the body; ongoing effects of colonialism-in theory and practice-on women worldwide; women's health; women and the environment; women's labor; political economy; transnational migrations; global class relations; women and/in the media; violence against women; women and war; the global sex/human trafficking trades; silence and marginalization; citizenship politics; women in politics and activism around the globe. The course examines contemporary feminist theory in the Global North and the Global South, highlighting the ways in which the term ""feminism"" continues to be contested. Given that we no longer talk about ""feminism"" in the singular in the United States, lack of agreement on the priorities of feminists worldwide is even more acute, given diverse cultural, political and economic positions of women around the globe. Thus the course also asks students to resist the kinds of generalizations that have led to inadequate feminist response to urgent challenges faced by women around the world. At the same time, the course will ask what kinds of connections can be made between local feminisms, and transnational feminist movement."
"WMNST 205: Gender, Diversity and the Media","COMM (WMNST) 205 Gender, Diversity and the Media (3) (GS;US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course examines diversity, equity and inclusion issues in media content, media business and media practice. Students examine communications scholarship, theory, media effects research and critical analysis of media content, policy and practice. Students learn about the media industry, its diverse distribution formats and representation patterns and the media role as public educator and social reality framer. Students research scholarship on human diversity issues in media representation and media effects and explore economic, political and social implications of media practice. Students critically analyze media content and media industry practice to build knowledge about ethical and responsible media practice. Course content is designed to help build deeper knowledge of how media interacts with identity formation, public knowledge and social understanding or misunderstanding of gender, race, ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation and class diversity, equity and inclusion. Students learn relevant communication theory to help explain how media interacts with our identity formation and our capability to navigate human difference in society. Students build critical thinking and media literacy skills, which are essential to navigate media and distinguish truth from fallacy. The course provides a foundation for further study of media in our diverse complex US democracy and global society and empowers students to interpret and pursue their interests, rights, and opportunities with ethics and integrity as media professionals."
WMNST 220: Beyond Birth Control: Feminist Perspectives on Women's Sexualities,"This course explores various aspects of women¿s sexualities from an interdisciplinary and intersectional feminist perspective. Assigned reading from feminist theory, social science research, and feminist sexologists will explore: the female body and embodied identities; the social construction of sexualities; sexual rights; sexual pleasure and desire; impacts of racism, poverty, sexism, heterosexism and transphobia on sexual identities; and how women make meaning of their sexual experiences. We also investigate models of sex and sexuality education that attend to queer and trans desire, sexuality and sexual identities."
WMNST 227: Introduction to Queer Theory,"Introduction to Sexuality Studies (3) (GH;US) This course focuses on the body of critical writings known as queer theory in order to analyze issues of sexuality and gender since 1969. The course interrogates sexual norms and their deviations, with a particular focus on the relationships between sexuality, imagination, and ethics in the making of sexual communities and fostering activism around sexuality and gender. We will study how class, race, and gender have been shaped, and themselves shape, the production of and resistance to sexual norms. Queer Theory engages issues ""queer space"" and ""queer time,"" related concepts that relate bodies and environments to history and memory, and to fantasy, imagination, and utopianism. We will also explore the ways marginalization, shame, and criminalization have been transformed into visionary acts of ""world-making"" that have changed contemporary understandings of bodies, identities, social formations, literature and visual culture. Throughout, our focus will be on the relationships between sexuality and ethics, and how both shape the history of queer culture and activism."
WMNST 266Y: Sexuality and Violence in Nineteenth-Century America,"HIST/ explores the social and cultural history of sexuality and violence in the United States during the nineteenth century. Both sexuality and violence are extremely broad topics, and the course will focus on a few intriguing elements of sexuality and violence, including courtship, prostitution, the early popular culture of sports, slavery, military violence, exploitative journalism, and sexuality and violence as metaphor. The course also examines the ""creation"" of homosexuality in the nineteenth century, and manner in which masculinity has been historically constructed."
WMNST 280: Gendering the Divine in Indian and South Asian Religions,"Throughout South Asia, ancient religious beliefs and cultural traditions interact with forms of modernity that constitute the daily lives and practices of women and men today. Focusing on conceptualizations of sex and gender over South Asia's long history, this course investigates the ways in which religious traditions and cosmologies have informed gender roles and hierarchies in India, Nepal, and other neighboring nations from the ancient period through the present day. In so doing, the course also explores how political realities-revolutions, terrorism, elections, nationalist movements, for example-can both exploit and challenge the gendered entanglements of religion and secular life. Students engage basic historical methods as well as feminist analytical methods (e.g., intersectionality) as they read a variety of cultural histories and ethnographies, as well as religious, philosophical and literary texts."
WMNST 297: Special Topics,"Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."

WMNST 439: Women and the Holocaust,"Analysis of women's experience in the Holocaust and exploration of the role of gender in Holocaust Studies.  J ST (HIST/WMNST) 439 Women and the Holocaust (3) Most of the early study of the Holocaust focused almost exclusively on the experiences of Jewish men. It was men who wrote the first and most widely read Holocaust memoirs and men who produced the first studies of the Holocaust. The first question motivating this class is thus what we can learn from examining women's experiences. Is it possible that the ghetto, the camp, and the forest look different from women's perspectives? Are there factors we miss when we read primary documents written by only half of the participants in these historical events? Beyond this, however, our exploration will also lead us to look more broadly at gender as a category of analysis. What do we gain by bringing questions of gender to bear on our study of the Holocaust? Are there any ethical concerns that should inform our approach?"
WMNST 455: Gender Roles in Communication,"Explores the literature on gender research in the discipline of human communication.  CAS (WMNST) 455 Gender Roles in Communication (3) (US) This 400-level course is a theory and application course which also satisfies an intercultural requirement. CAS/ strives to ensure that students understand female and male differences and similarities in communication patterns, perceptions of the opposite sex, and expectations and stereotypes regarding the opposite sex. Many researchers find that gender communication is 'cross cultural' i.e., that women and men come from two different cultures, and therefore misunderstanding of each others' intent and expectations may frequently occur. This course examines how distinctions in meaning and interpersonal dynamics may create these two differing cultures, and promotes understanding and possibilities for adaptation. It also investigates when and if changing communication styles is desirable, and in which settings. A goal of the course is to help students to solve puzzles toward understanding those we work with and relate to, as well as to apply their knowledge to their own lives and contexts. The course content and format reflects these goals. CAS/ begins with theoretical information, later applying it to situations of interest to most -- relationships, language use differences (verbal and nonverbal), media messages, and workplace issues. Lecture incorporates considerable discussion and exploration of gender issues, and most topics are followed by activities, which illustrate how theories work in real life. This course is useful for any students seeking an intercultural course. It is recommended to Communications Arts and Sciences and Women's Studies majors and minors due to emphasis on communication theory and gender issues. Business, counseling, psychology, sociology, education and any social science majors may fulfill a US requirement through 455."
WMNST 489: British Women Writers,"A study of selected British women writers.  ENGL (WMNST) 489 British Women Writers (3) This course provides the opportunity to study writing by British Women from a historical perspective and to explore the views these women have of themselves as artists. The course will concentrate on a careful reading of works by a variety of authors. It will address the question of the role gender plays in the selection of literary forms and the development of character, theme, symbols, and rhetorical strategies. It will also explore what particular dimensions British women writers have brought to the British literary tradition.Students will be active learners through keeping reading journals, presenting background reports on the history of women in England, participating in small-group discussions about the texts, and writing 2 shorter essays and one longer research essay for the class. This course focuses on an area of British literature, which more traditionally structured courses tend to obscure. The course will be attractive to students from a variety of programs, including English majors, Women's Studies minors, and Interdisciplinary Humanities students. The course will be offered once every two years. Estimated class size 20."
